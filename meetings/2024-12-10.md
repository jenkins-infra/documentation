## Announcements

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.488 was released succesfully the 3rd December
        * Hiccup during the Windows packaging due to a PR merged in jenkinsci/packaging not working with the release Windows container image
        * Change rollbacked, root cause found and explained by @slide
        * Note: @slide is helping by trying to add the required Windows packaging tools (Wik setup) into our packer template so we could start using the same image on both ci.jio and release.ci.jio
