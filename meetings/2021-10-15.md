## Announcement :loudspeaker:



## Notes :book:

* AWS Cost Management: <https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3097>
    * We are over the 8k$ monthly sponsorship (15k$ last month :scream:)
    * Priority for the upcoming weeks
    * Discuss cost saving ideas in the ticket
    * Special thanks to Jesse Glick for guidance
	
* pkg.jenkins.io machine work in preparation
  * updates.jenkins.io - <https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3100>
  * pkg.jenkins.io
  * Packaging environment
  * Removing mirror.jenkins-ci.org (deprecated)
  * Snowflake not currently managed by puppet
      * Consider moving services to other cloud providers
      * Outbound data transfer is 50 TB per month
          * $3k per month AWS data transfer costs
		  
* **Traefik Ingress Controller**: Our friend [Joseph Petersen](https://github.com/jetersen) is [ok to work on the Traefik Ingress Controller in AKS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/charts/pull/1559#issuecomment-942165648)
  * Initial discussion was back in [Feb. 2021](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2743?focusedCommentId=404888page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-404888)
  * Value: Traefik manages Let's Encrypt certificate on its own, it's lightweight and easier to manager in k8s than nginx (less annotations, less specific configuration, full TCP support)
      * More portable, easier to manage Kubernetes
      * Simplify SSL certificate management
      * If Joseph is willing to assist, good contribution
  * Proposal: start working on the private-ingress
  * Kubernetes cluster upgrade
      * Will be mandatory in future kubernetes 1.22 upgrade
* Review current infrastructure [roadmap](https://www.jenkins.io/project/roadmap/)
  * AWS account needs to transfer to CDF
  * Account is currently paid by CloudBees
      * Limits access to only CloudBees employees
  * Thanks Herve and Mark for updating the roadmap recenly!
* Issue Triage
    * See the Jira project
    * Close open tickets that are no longer relevant
    * Beta GitHub issues is now available to us
	* There is not easy path to contribute to Jira issue which means we have a lot of not appropriated issues for INFRA
* DocSearch Algolia
  * Gavin requested access to index blog posts and more
  * Algolia docsearch entirely managed by Algolia
      * We insert a Javascript snippet on www.jenkins.io
  * Mark Waite opened Algolia support ticket ID412592
  * www.jenkins.io?
  * docsearch offered to OSS project we just need to inject a javascript
  * not configuration 
  * plugins.jenkins.io is data driven so better to have better specific account.
