## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.539 - successful - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$Whg248rW0emMOyKFL9uoPU0cCSsK0KQgyGVVZkXYII4?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
        * Packaging worked as expected BUT the cron on pkg.origin.jenkins.io was forgotten: it broke the RPM and debian indexes for ~30min.
        * Contains a CSP bugfix.
        * Release process failed once due to test issues. Second tentative went well.
    * This Week: 2.540 - started on time - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$izbi7BQ35DucNx4j82jN9y5iFSHOeKIau977KmkzomU?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im
        * Packages changes:
            * Staging per branch is now supported, and introduced staging only, promotion only
            * Manual promotion required only this time (avoid bad surprises for LTS next week)
            * openSUSE instructions changed to support autorefresh
            
2. Announcements:
    * Weekly trigger time: What if we trigger weeklies 6 hours earlier to fit with Jay's timezone?
        * => Mark have not asked Tim yet. No emergency :)
    * Incoming team holidays:
        * Jay is off starting next week, for 3 weeks. Back on the 29 Dec. 2025.
        * Mark, Herve and Damien off from 22 Dec. 2025 afor 2 weeks, back on 5th January 2026
    * Infra Roadmap: https://www.jenkins.io/project/roadmap/
        * Current Priority: pkg.origin.jenkins.io migration
        * Roadmap deserves an update for beginning December (Herve + Damien)
        * Upcoming things not tracked by issues yet:
            * PostgreSQL to be upgraded (current managed version in Azure unsupported). Caught by Tim while working on rating changes
            * Rating(.jenkins.io) PR which will require DB changes
            * Docker 29.x => need an issue, but since docker-plugin fails with this version let's put it on hold until fixed
            * Terraform 1.13 => need an issue
    * Jenkins Elections are completed. Congratulations on newly elected officer and board members!

## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/187?closed=1):
    * Support:
        * [Request to Re-trigger Jenkins Job Due to Suspected False Failure](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4885)
        * [discourse account is hosed](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4883)
        * [Admin access for Jenkins GSoC org admins to GSoC SiG Gitter channel](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4712)
            * Handed over to the board, closeable as per last Kris message.

* [Work in Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/187):
    * Keep infrastructure up to date:
        * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.33](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4820)
            * WiP: ensuring Jay and Herve have access, tooling and setup for all Kubernetes clusters
            * Change of order: starting with AWS EKS (e.g. ci.jenkins.io), ideally this week
                * Then infra.ci.jenkins.io Azure AKS cluster (agents) this week eventually
            * private and public, most probably in the upcoming 2 weeks, by Herve but without Jay (holidays)
        * [Add support for Windows 2025 agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4791)
            * WiP: Trying to use Windows 2025 as host to build both 2025 and 2022 container images 
                * virtualization ain't a piece of cake ;)
                * ci.jenkins.io with AWS EC2 shows random errors when running this "all in one" setup. We had to check it wasn't related to hardware/virtualization stuff.
                    * But last 10 builds were stable: needs to wrap analysis.
                * Next step: moving windows nod pool of privatek8s cluster out of 2019 to (latest available)
        * [[trusted.ci.jenkins.io] Update Center credential for Cloudflare R2 expires on `2025-12-04`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4879)
            * Herve and Damien to pair on this tomorrow. WiP on gathering permission requirements for Herve.
    * Keep infrastructure sane and maintainable:
        * [[pkg.jenkins.io] migrate the pkg.origin.jenkins.io service from AWS VM to Azure `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3705)
            * [[release.ci.jenkins.io/trusted.ci.jenkins.io] Ensure Core Package build only copy package indexes/websites to `pkg.origin.jenkins.io` VM](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4774)
                * Waiting for 2.528.3 LTS release to have some of the weekly packaging changes backported: staging and RPM repo created on release.ci, but not the RH/openSUSE unified RPM process.
            * Then we can move to the pkg.origin.jenkins.io service in Azure with 2 main changes:
                * Nginx instead of Apache (end of .htaccess)
                * Eventually less data served
            * [dnf5 update fails with gpgcheck=1](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4429)
