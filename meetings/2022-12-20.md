## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/46?closed=1) (7):
  * [javadoc build is failing (`zdevops.jar` is not a valid ZIP file)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3290)
      * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/javadoc/blob/c1ad9da53d6646e3ad61920b025042b2ead4a6eb/Jenkinsfile#L39 is slow and could be avoided on PRs
  * [Install renovate on asciidoctor-jenkins-extensions](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3303)
      * Useful for jenkins.io updates such as blueocean/maven/java updates?
  * [JFrog Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org) maintenance: Cloud migration from GCP to AWS by JFrog teams](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3288)
  * [forgott username and password](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3301)
  * [Account not found](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3300)
  * [CD failure on `scm-api-plugin`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3297)
  * [jenkins-io-components](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3295)
  * [Azure: Re-create networks to fix overlap issues and support of IPv6](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3257)
      * Damien to open follow ups issues for IPv6 and VPN VM for public net. (not mandatory for now)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/46) (12):
  * [Bump the terraform module for AWS EKS (and consequences)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3305)

    * This issue is postponed until network and cluster are not suffering from the IPv4 overlap
  * [[INFRA-3080] Add Windows Server 2022](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2629)
      * Validate the contributor request and then can be closed
      * Note that Windows (2022 and 2019) are failing to be built on AWS. Might be worth it to only rely on Azure for them.

      * Waiting for Daniel feedback: postponing

      * WiP: work on the VPN routing to reach this new controller
          * VPN routing is OK from laptop to VPN VM
          * VPN VM reaches the infra.ci ingress
          * Gotta check the VM iptable routing/masquerading
