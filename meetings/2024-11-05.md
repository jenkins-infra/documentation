## Notes :book:

<!-- Generate the content below from the GHA workflow https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/actions/workflows/infra-meeting-release.yaml -->

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/134?closed=1):
    * Update Center:
        * [[Azure Update Center] Serve directory listing instead of redirecting to mirrors (ending in HTTP/404)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4373)
        * [[cloudflare] Collect access logs in a location where we can view and request them](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4372)
  * [Update ci.jenkins.io, trusted.ci, cert.ci and release.ci to latest LTS version 2.479.1](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4370)
  * [Artifact Caching proxy issue (Pipeline can't find the remote artifactory)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4367)
      * Plugin contributor did break their `pom.xml` but we helped them fix it (by... rollbacking their change of `repository.id`)
  * [Adding GSoC project to jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4260)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/134?closed=1):
    * Thanks @timja for helping plugin contributor in:
        * [CD pipeline for railflow-testrail plugin fails to upload to maven repo](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4371)
        * [CD pipeline fails to upload to Artifactory for some users](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4374)

* [Work in Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/134):
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * We need a 6th brownout!
            * Proposal: Thursday 7 Nov. 09:00am UTC -> Friday 8 Nov. 09:00am UTC
                * Need blog post, status.jio ASAP
        * To do before production
            * Conclude that the 6th brownout shows no red flag (5th brownout did not)
            * Add a `mirrorbits refresh` step in the update_center2 `publish` script before scanning mirrors
                * Warning: time impact?
                * Alternative: decrease the refresh repo frequency to 10 min (today) to 3-4 min (based on the required time)
            * Add archives.jenkins.io as a 3rd mirror (send data to it, and add it as a mirror) with a lower weight
                * Goal: add an alternative to Cloudflare
                * Risk: do not consume too much DigitalOcean billing on it
                * Using as a fallback instead of a mirror? Depends on the result of mirrorbits refresh
        * Proposed production date: Monday 18 November at 09:00am UTC
