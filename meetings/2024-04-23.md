    * [Block spam generating user reloaddigital88@gmail.com](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4053)
    * [Update ci.jenkins.io, trusted.ci, cert.ci and release.ci to latest LTS version 2.440.3](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4050)
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Terraform Azure job fails with `Total node count 56 requires 71680 ports but only 64000 ports are available given 1 outbound public IPs`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4046)
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Azure AD Password expired for `terraform-production` (jenkins-infra/azure)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4045)
    * [Let's Encrypt Azure Service Principal passwords expired for `cert.ci.jenkins.io` and `trusted.ci.jenkins.io`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4043)
    * [Migrate `release.ci.jenkins.io` to arm64 (controller only)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4042)
    * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/108?closed=1):
  * [MISMATCH](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4054)
  * [not able to login](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4049)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/108):
    * [renew Service Principal Password before expiration for application sponsorship.ci.jenkins.io-tf-managed](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4052)
        * Todo (later): improve updatecli PR to give directions (runbook) on what to do when merged
        * Todo (later): With this updatecli automated process: create an issue (with or without the PR) on helpdesk so we can track it for meetings (and replace calendar events)
        * Todo (later): factorize some of the code to reuse the same on all terraform repositories
        * Next step for this issue:
            * Approve, Merge and take care of the new credentials for ci.jenkins.io => @dduportal 
            * New PR to add the "runbook" => dduportal
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * The "new" UC (azure.updates.jenkins.io) is missing some UC redirects (redirect by Apache today when requesting a dynamic UC with a query string)
            * Routing at reverse-proxy using query string is dangerous and slow => let's avoid doing it on the (shared ingress
            * Besides, this "routing/redirect" logic is already available in the generated Apache2's .htaccess => let's not reinvent the wheel
            * Proposal: send everything to (the new) Apache2 and add a vhost fallback to a new DNS (mirrors.updates.jenkins.io) which sends remaining requests without query string to mirrorbits
        * Next steps:
            * Fix the above behavior to handle dynamic URLs (with a QS)
            * Then back to stress tests and JEP review
                * We have reports of hit rate and bandwidth from today's logs
    * [[AWS] Migrate ci.jenkins.io EKS clusters from CloudBees AWS account to Jenkins AWS (sponsored) account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3954)
        * IAM permissions pattern is going on the right direction
            * StÃ©phane and Damien have accounts with the expected "non root + MFA + assumeRole"
        * WiP:
            * Setting up technical Terraform IAM users
            * Start a first EKS cluster
                * IAM profile to be managed NOT by the terraform module
                * Name of the cluster is `ci.jenkins.io-agents` (or `cijenkinsio-agents` or `cijio-agents`)
                * Only 1 cluster instead of 2: ACP will be internal only on AWS
    * [JDK patch upgrade campaign (April 2024)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4058)
      * Issue written to have a "map" of where to upgrade JDKs
      * Tools JDK should be up to date
      * WiP on controller/agents
          * Windows containers are next
      * Agents: let's verify with @smerle 's list
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Build of the jenkins-infra/docker-inbound-agents are failing since 20 March 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4048)
        * Fix test phase to allow JDK upgrades
            * Disable tests?

    * [Support for Visual Studio in windows container image](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4047)
        * Only Windows VM images (ci.j ephemeral agents)
        * Requirement for building `winp` on ci.jenkins.io
        * WiP:
            * PR from Alex Earl to install it in our agent templates. Windows 2019 works, WiP on Windows 2022 support (installation stuck on Win 2022), fix currently tested
            * Then release and deploy a new version to provide something to Pierrick
        * If Alex needs (and want) maintainer access to the repo + VPN access: let's roll (no objection during team meeting)
    * [migrate storage from premium to standard for jenkins-infra, jenkins-weekly and jenkins-release](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4044)
         * Goal: save Azure (CDF paid!) money by using cheaper SSDs for jenkins homes
         * Starting with weekly.ci (process in the issue) to validate the process, before proceeding on infra.ci and release.ci
         * Done: Storage class created on both clusters
         * Todo:
             * weekly.ci (next week monday/tuesday)
    * [[Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org)] perform a systematic audit of all non-plugin  artifacts in our `releases` repository to identify and quarantine unused artifacts](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4034)

        * Back to backlog (no team capacity)
    * [migrate plugin-site-api generate-data from ci.jenkins.io to infra.ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4009)
        * Back to backlog (no team capacity)
    * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by RCS&RDS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4003)
        * Waiting for mirror provider feedback (HTTPS missinbg on their side)
    * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by Hostico](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3976)
        * Damien takes it over to verify the FTP credentials are supported by mirrorbits
