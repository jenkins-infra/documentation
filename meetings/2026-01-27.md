    * November: $5.7k (invoice)
    * December: $5.4k (invoice)
    * January: $4.8k (forecast at $5.8k)

* Azure Sponsorship (Microsoft Credits): still stuck. 
    * We see the $100k credits in the account but can't use them
    * Alex Brandes (NotMyFault) is on it (dealing with Microsoft Support and Partner program). Send him hugs.

* DigitalOcean - Remaining $10,411.25 until January 02, 2027 (20 months left at current rate)
    * October: $788.81 (invoice)
    * November: $831.38 (invoice)
    * December: $454.60 (invoice, previously forecasted at $585)

        * October: $6.9k
        * November: $5.9k
        * December: $10.7 (previously forecasted at $9.5k way higher than usual)
            * Huge increase due to EC2 plugin bug
        * January: $13.4k (forecast at $15.3k, previously at $15.7k)
            * Still really high, ci.jenkins.io is once again at risk if we don't decrease the consumption or if we don't move it somewhere else before end of April 2026
            * Need an issue ASAP for the EC2 agents GC (Damien)
            * Need an issue for packer image various resources cleanup

    * Bandwidth:
        * October: 16.67 Tb
        * November: 15.9 Tb
        * December: 30.34Tb
            * A single IP address consumed 12Tb in December
            * JFrog didn't block this address until this month (unless this consumer changed its IP?)
        * January: 13.83 Tb (forecast at 15.9 Tb, previously at 16.5 Tb)
            * Sounds like the abuser stopped abusing
