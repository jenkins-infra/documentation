## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Announcement
    * 2.332 weekly release delivered - needs jarsigner validation fix
    * Infra has switched to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues) instead of Jira issues
    * New Java releases coming - JDK 8u322, JDK 11.0.14, JDK 17.0.2
        * See [Eclipse Temurin progress report](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/issues/109)


## Notes :book:

* Digital Ocean: @lemeurherve is finishing the first path
  * Path 1: Kubernetes cluster (managed by Terraform) with 2 node.
      * Tracked in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2651
      * Target: ci.jenkins.io Linux container workloads (out from EKS)
      * Using as supplementary agents for ci.jenkins.io
      * 2 nodes pools:
          * one with one node on the smallest size
          * the other more beefy with autoscaling enabled in order to be able to increase capacity of this nodes pool without recreating the cluster)
  * Path 2 (to be done) VM agent for ci.jenkins.io (suggested by Gavin if Kubernetes costs us too much in maintenance time)

* Scaleway: same as Digital Ocean, @lemeurherve will look into it after DO
    * Tracked in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2668
<!-- Delayed from next week -->
* Work on the private AKS cluster
  * Need to finish the "terraform shared library" to ensure AWS, datadog, DO and Azure have the same behavior. (WIP by @dduportal)

* Building Docker Images on infra.ci/release.ci
  * Docker Linux AMD64: move from "docker-less" to docker VMs
  * @smerle working on this, see the GitHub issue to track it

* infra.ci's credentials

* ci.jenkins.io timeouts for aws-secrets-manager-secret-source & aws-secrets-manager-credentials-provider plugins
    * https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/h6klfdeM8tM

* Alibaba mirror
    * https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/jAS3wawXeqY
    * Mark had a location question that had no reply
        * Created a new thread in the mailing list, no reply
    * Proceed with adding the mirror

* census.jenkins.io: Damien *still* has to ask Tyler/Olivier about the "what does it do?"

* Day 2 day operations:
  * Disable anti spam for cert team: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2703
  * Move ci.jenkins.io auth (since matrix-auth-plugin 3.0) config to CasC: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2708
      * Ambiguous groups need to be made precise
  * Mark Waite blocked a ci.jenkins.io API spammer at the Linux kernel
      * Gavin Mogan suggested using redirects instead
      * Arnaud Heritier suggested using fail2ban to monitor logs
      * See [issue 2759](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2759) for details
      * Azure public-network-datatier security group could be used to block an IP address easier than iptables
