  * [Node.js missing on agent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3222)
      * Issue ASDF + NodeJS and the env. 
      * Should we use official NodeJS?
      * Alternatives: NVM
      * => install node from official installer, first on docker-builder, then on packer images
  * [Publish `pipeline-steps-doc-generator` and `backend-extension-indexer` artifacts to some kind of storage](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3087)

      * Damien and Stephane
  * [Artifact caching proxy unable to deliver git-changelist-maven-extension](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3221)
      * 2 issues: 
          * one is from maven central (and not ACP)
          * second comes from the azure's ACP (HTTP/504). Checked in datadog: sounds like network issues on prodpublick8s (IP overlapping).
      * Let's prioritize the privatek8S + publick8s fixups.
  * [Add an help desk template for account recovery issues](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3205)
      * Herve will open a draft open for feedbacks
  * [Backlog of already built items in queue on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3211)
      * Waiting for the 16th
  * [(Re) Introduce an artifact caching proxy for ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2752)
      * 3 ACPs are running
      * We get datadog metrics and logs for all of them
      * Herve watching it, but priority on "Azure IP overlap" solving
      * Improvement on the pipeline-library:
          * Define "available" ACPs as env vars (feature flag)
          * Run an healthcheck before a build, to fallback to JFrog if current ACP is down
          * (and some minor fixes ;)) 
  * [Migrate Keycloak database to Azure](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3214)
      * New database created in Azure (on the current "public" postgres instance)
      * WiP: initial backup/restore
  * [[INFRA-2754] Realign repo.jenkins-ci.org mission](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2322)
      * Migration to be defined, old instance to be kept one month
      * Bandwidth decrease: Mark and Damien to write and hack to find a proper path
      * Work on HA LDAP (at least read-only replica) to be started
  * [AKS: add cluster `privatek8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2844)
      * Create a new cluster with terraform using a managed identity instead of a service principal
      * Migrate services from temp-privatek8s to this new cluster
      * Migrate services from prodpublick8s to this new private cluster
          * infra, release
          * monitoring
          * bots (only need egress)
  * [(proposal) Add external-dns to the Kubernetes cluster with an ingress (and a loadbalancer)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3194)
      * Go back to the backlog!
