      * Disabled temporarily to help user (confirmed)
      * 
  * [track the new jdk21 version from adoptium](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3783)
      * Packer image: need a fix on the provisioning scripts (remove `ea`)
      * Puppet (jenkins-infra):
          * Same we have to update the template with the new URL
          * Except for `s390x` which need to stick to the ea until latest is OK 
  * [Trying to create a new jenkins community account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3782)
      * Let's check there a no account with this email and this username as first step
  * [Packer: GOSS version tracking and moving sanity check to goss](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3763)
      * Goss is used for `asdf` and `npm` now (with the `jenkins` user running it: end to end testing instead of only "sanity")
      * Next: migrate more sanity checks on linux to goss (StÃ©phane)
      * Next: add goss to Windows checks
  * [Migrate Terraform states from AWS S3 to Azure buckets](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3762)
      * AWS IAM temp user created for the migration, which is valid only 1 week (to be deleted once finished)
      * WiP on fastly
      * Todo: AWS and digitalocean Terraform projects
  * [speed up the Docker image library to create/push tags at the same time for both GH and Docker (instead of running additional build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3751)
      * WiP: Still working on unit tests to define the new behavior. Need pairing and time alone

      * Changelog to finish checking
      * Preparing DO and KS
  * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
      * HervÃ© takes the lead, need knowledge sharing with StÃ©phane
      * Status: rating.jenkins.io and the Nginx private ingress (including our `jenkinsciinfra/404` default web backend) of `publick8s` are in ARM64
      * Next step: shared sessions between HervÃ© and StÃ©phane
      * VPN VM to arm64 => Damien
      * issues:
          * matomo must stay on x86
          * falco (agent) crashing on the latest Ubuntu 22.04 kernels => need to upgrade falco. Damien with pairing
  * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
      * HervÃ© volunteers to help for next steps
      * Should we re-evaluate this choice?
          * Google Analytics v4 (need account superadmin: KK)
          * Keep matomo (less Google, need to learn, we can then import gavin data)
          * Other platforms: plausible?
      * Let's try with matomo a 2nd time:
          * Remove the "no peristence constraint"
          * Use the full bitnami image + chart, and then we'll see if we need to integrate Gavin's customizations
  * [Planning for supported JDK versions in Jenkins Infrastructure](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3289)
      * JEP for JDK 2+2+2
          * Is "2 months prior a new LTS release through early access" acceptable for infra?
              * We did it for JDK21
              * EA version are usually available 6-8 month before release
              * As the JDK releases are now deterministic (LTS every 2 years), infra team can add calendar event with reminder to check the new JDKs EAs
          * Is "1 month after EOL of a Java release for Jenkins we remove it" acceptable for infra?
              * Example: December 1 of 2024, JDK11 removed from build agents.
              * Breaks plugins not updated but still using JDK11, but infra can't deliver new security fixes on JDK11
              * Questions:
                  * "What happens to broken plugins? What is the policy?" => these plugins will soon be either "security-advisored" or made incomaptible with the 
          * What about the "non LTS" JDKs?
              * Costs due to paralleliez builds by adding non LTS
              * Is it needed on core or plugins? => we don't have an answer, the current JEP only cover the LTS
              * Unless there is a compelling reason, infra will not provide non-LTS JDK
      * JDK19 deletion:
          * TODO: ci.jenkins.io infra acceptance tests
          * TODO: Windows container agent
          * TODO: cleanup updatecli shell scripts (checking for JDK19)
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Knowledge sharing session with Stephane for handover this milestone
      * Status:
          * WiP: Tests of copying to both AWS S3 (Cloudlfare) and Azure file share (mirrorbits reference bucket) from update-center2 trusted agent, trying to have (generation + rsync + aws s3 sync + azcopy) in less than 3 minutes
          * 2:30 to 3:00: is Daniel ok to extend to 5 min the max time limit?
          * Let's try paralelization
              * First a naive parallel with background task (`&` suffix and then `wait`)
              * GNU `parallel` if it works
              * `rclone` is not an option alas.:
                  * can't parellize copy from 1 source to multiple targets
                  * slower for AWS S3 copies
      * Helm chart ingress for the new mirrorbits => Damien

* New topics:
    * jenkins.io deletion of old pages (add `--delete` flag to the jenkins.io deployment process)
        * Documentation team did the checks and we are green
        * Need a backup before trying it (to ensure quick rollback if any problem)
        * Proposal: let's do it Thursday 19 ?
    * Retiring the ZH jenkins.io website - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3379
        * What can Kevin do to help?
        * Let's pair, and involve Mark next week as well

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/86)
