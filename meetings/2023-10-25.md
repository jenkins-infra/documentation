## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly:

   * Changelog merged
2. "Missing `-jdk17` container tags"
  * LTS changelog for 2.414.3 updated to warn users
  * Fix for today's weekly (see above)
  * We plan to backport missing tags to 2.414.3 using binary copy with `skopeo` to avoid rebuild (and accidental overrides)
3. Remoting versions 3176 and 3180 had a bug when using "direct connection" (no websockets, no TCP discovery)
  * ci.jenkins.io was impacted but no user facing problem
  * version 3181 of remoting fixed the issue
  * rolling it out to ci.jenkins.io

## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/86?closed=1):
  * [Lost write access to credentials-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3797)
  * [Need Github permissions for Developers](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3796)
  * [Create a `coverage-plugin` component in the JENKINS Jira project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3795)
  * [Archive Jira component `extra-tool-installers-plugin`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3794)
  * [Wrong plugin redirect](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3791)
  * [Trying to create a new jenkins community account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3782)
  * [Migrate Terraform states from AWS S3 to Azure buckets ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3762)
  * [plugin-site build commonly fails on infra.ci when accessing https://plugins.jenkins.io resulting in a 502](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3697)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/86):
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Knowledge sharing done (Herve -> Stephane)
      * WIP: update-center2 script executed every 3 minute 
          * Parallelization applied on the copy of JSON to different targets (rsync to VM, AWS S3 sync to R2, Azcopy to Azure filestorage). Timing looks really good
          * symlinks issue fixed by using a local rsync with safe dereferencing of links + exclusions of all `updates/` directories (crawler)
          * PR from Daniel to remove the "latest" : less data to copy \o/ - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/747
          * TODO: trigger mirrorbits sync at the end (after the parallel steps). Requires a bit of Kubernetes.
      * WIP: mirrorbits ingress fix (nothing done except reproducing the issue locally)
  * [ftp.belnet.be should be removed from mirrors or a fall-back offered](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3784)
      * Still disabled
      * Can't reproduce reporter's network problem, hard to tell where the error is
      * Let's contact mirror admins through the public support email
  * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
      * Knowledge sharing done (Stephane -> Herve)
      * Migrated:
          * public Nginx ingress :party:
          * incremental-publisher
      * WiP:
          * Publishing arm64 for all the other Docker repositories
          * Some are not easy (rabbit hole):
              * uplink is using node 9 / node 10, need a bit of upgrade. Let's check if there are node 9 /10 arm images.
          * next candidates to deploy:
              * (our own docker image) plugin-site-api
              * (our own docker image) mirrorbits (current)
              * (our own docker image) mirrorbits-parent (with httpd, rsync and mirrorbits)
              * cert-manager
              * datadog-cluster-agent
      * Next:
          * weekly.ci.jenkins.io => easy as controller only
      * ARM64 on other locations of the platform (future)?
          * privatek8s cluster: adding an arm64 node pool to be used by infra.ci for agents
          * VPN VM
      * Takeaway: It's not only about shrinking cost (because arm64 is cheaper for the same workload), but also a cleanup of services \o/
  * ["Mirror Status" link from get.jenkins.io returns a 404 error](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3790)
      * TODO
  * [Publishing Jenkins Security Scan rules as packages](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3789)
      * To answer and close
  * [track the new jdk21 version from adoptium](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3783)
      * Knowledge sharing (Bruno + Stephane -> Damien)
      * Next step: windows containers and tools installation
      * s390x tool installation will cherrypick Herve's work from jenkinsci/docker images
  * [Packer: GOSS version tracking and moving sanity check to goss](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3763)
      * Linux's `asdf` and `nodejs` and `npm` are checked (NPm is always "latest")
      * Linux other tools: WiP PR - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/pull/852
      * Windows PR ready to review: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/pull/818
      * Next: factorize and move all to goss
  * [speed up the Docker image library to create/push tags at the same time for both GH and Docker (instead of running additional build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3751)
      * TDD started
      * handover to do this week before Stephane is off
