    * [Branch protection exception on Jenkins Security Scan repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3802)
    * [Publishing Jenkins Security Scan rules as packages](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3789)
    * [Reset/Disable 2FA for oleg-nenashev on community.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3804)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/87?closed=1):
    * [Demo issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3808)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/87):
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * update-center 2 script paralellization for JSON deployment works very well.
        * WiP: triggering mirrorbit scan as last step of the script.
        * WiP: mirrorbits ingress. Fixed issue, tuning of ingress rule as a next step.
        * Mirrorbits sustainability: VLC's creator, JB. Kempf gained ownership of the project for adoption. Good news for us and incoming mirrorbits update after a few years.
    * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
        * WiP on uplink
            * Cleanup required to build and ship it one time after 4 years with no deployments while leveraging risks (`npm ci`, etc.).
                * Done with success!
            * Image is now built both for x86 and arm64 and deployed with success :party:
        * Next steps: 
            * Migrating cert-manager and datadog-cluster agent to arm64
            * Identify the 2-3 services requiring arm64 images
        * Also: fix falco crashing on arm64 by upgrading it to latest version (or remove it)
    * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.26](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3683)
        * DigitalOcean was succesfully upgraded last week
        * WiP EKS upgrade. Need to check CNI plugin version as a requirement, otherwise ready to go.
            * Impact: worst case, BOM builds will be delayed in the queue until operation is finished.
        * TODO: AKS, but need falco upgrade before (so next week most probably)
    * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
        * Nothing done (not enought time)
        * Back to backlog for now
    * [Packer: GOSS version tracking and moving sanity check to goss](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3763)
        * Windows packer images are now using goss
        * external contributor added playwright AND goss sanity check
        * WiP: Covering all the Linux tests with goss
        * Todo: add a "goss-common" harness
    * [track the new jdk21 version from adoptium](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3783)
        * WiP: JDK tool (and trusted build agent)

        * Nothing done (not enough time)
        * Back to backlog for now
    * ["Mirror Status" link from get.jenkins.io returns a 404 error](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3790)
        * WiP: analysis
            * Do we need it, or to update the link?
            * Need to check requirement to have archives.jenkins.io as fallback (bandwidth in DigitalOcean)
    * [ftp.belnet.be should be removed from mirrors or a fall-back offered](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3784)
        * WiP: Need to contact belnet admins
    * [Ensure removed jenkins.io pages aren't accessible and indexed anymore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3360)
        * WiP: plan it this week, most probably Thursday
            * Backup OK
            * Requirement OK
            * One last "restore" test of the root folder file
            * todo: merge PR and profit!

        * JDK19 cleaned up
            * Need one last check in GH
        * 2+2+2 JEP: need ci.jenkins.io documentation update, then we'll move to the JEP's implementation part (with checklist \o/)
    
* New items:
    * [Merging core PRs doesn't cancel PR builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3807)
        * TBD
        * Long term (unicorn world with rainbows): JobDSL-ization of ci.jenkins.io would avoid such configuration "shift"
    * [Start a new repo under jenkins-infra for the Jenkins Contributor Spotlight feature on jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3809)
        * Does it "increment" stories.jenkins.io (`/contributors` for instance)? or does it a secondary website such as contributors.jenkins.io?
            * Already have a 2nd website with previe as per Kris work => secondary website looks easier
            * Proposal: link in stories.jenkins.io to redirect to the new website 
            * contributors.stories.jenkins.io / users.stories.jenkins.io
        * Hypothesis of "secondary website"
            * Need to fork the repo to jenkins-infra
                * WiP: Permission
            * TODO:
                * CI (preview website)
                * Production (same as stories.jenkins.io most probably)
                * CD (extend CI to production)
    * [Add Bruno Verachten to the GSoC team](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3803)
