## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last week: 2.493 released with no issues.
    * This Week: 2.494 started on time today
2. Azure Outages impacting Container Instances
    * Reminder:
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4490
        * Scope: only Windows container builds on ci.jenkins.io
        * Communication done last week after team meeting (including installation of customize-header plugin)
        * We are still in "degraded" mode: the temporary fix (using VM agents instead of containers) stays until migration to AWS => w
    * Issues to create:
        * Write down procedure to switch labels to VM (without breaking JDK selection) => @dduportal 
        * Monitoring should alert us when agent allocations starts to fail => @dduportal 
            * Increase build retention for jenkins-infra-plugin and the Infra/acceptance-tests
            * Datadog monitor (for both builds): status? build time?
            * See if pattern emerges to trigger alerts
    * New impact detected by @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag on Jenkins Core Tests which times out around 6h. Short term: if no immediate solution disable test until we've migrated to AWS anbd then re-analysis.
3. No team meeting the 4 February 2025 (post-FOSDEM)
