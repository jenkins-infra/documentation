      * New one inserted in Azure
      * Need to check:
          * MSI signing
          * Jar signing (by maven)
      * Today's weekly is released with old cert.
          * Packaging is configured for no MSI at all
      * Alternative 1 - continue packaging as is (no MSI) (current weekly, no MSI)
      * Alternative 2 - add MSI to packaging and new signing (current weekly, includes MSI and signed war file)
          * Validates MSI signing, does not validate war file signing
      * Alternative 3 - new weekly build using the new certificate + MSI back
          * Validates MSI signing and war file signing
      * 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive
      * Let's go for 2. Then see 3. before LTS tomorrow
      * @dduportal will ask validation to @timja before proceeding, and we'll let know Kris Stern (as the LTS lead) and Alex Brandes (as a frequent release lead)
