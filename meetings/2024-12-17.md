## Additional Topics

* Quick not-so-off-topic - JCP meeting on Dec 17 and JEP-14 feedback
    * Java Community Process - caring for Java Enhancement Proposals
    * Working group that focuses on technical topics
    * Tip and Tail - how Java version things, how libraries version things
        * Mark to attend session and share Jenkins 2+2+2
* Jenkins and Develocity FOSS sponsorship - is there still potential interest - 
  * https://github.com/gradle/develocity-oss-projects
  * "Develocity open source sponsorship for Jenkins CI instances" - thread in  jenkins-infra@googlegroups.com - https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/KveP8_0b3zk/m/FjlfcFm2BQAJ 
    * Develocity - distributed build caching, build scans, predictive test selection (might overlap with CloudBees' offering being deployed), etc.
    * Some first metrics for Jenkins plugins are nice (4x build boost for a Maven based plugin), but a champion is needed to explore further. Oleg has a CoI as a Gradle employee
    * The opportunity is still there, not sure about the budget allocation. If there is no follow-up, Gradle will definitely move on.
    * Damien: interested in the infra part
    * Oleg to follow-up with Damien in January-ish. Some technical details would be needed
* AWS account use for AWS Java SDK v2 work - [JENKINS-73638](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-73638)
    * Jenkins infra is very interested in the AWS improvements
        * Concerned about the EC2 plugin already
    * Can allocate one or more developers an IAM profile on a distinct region
        * Will need to predict the needed resources for that IAM profile
        * What is need to start that process?
            * Create a help desk ticket with the list of users and the use case
                * Infra will generate the credentials and share them securely with the contributors
            * May need a workshop session at Contributor Summit on AWS Java SDK v2

                * Require benchmarking, which require.. ACP.
