      * Let's check documentation/runbook/material. If no one: le'ts ask Olivier (but only after searching)
      * Do we need to extend the key validity? Or add a new key ? Impacts?
      * Last time: a blog post was written
  * [Out of space on a ci.jenkins.io agent in bom build](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3423)
      * Root problem fixed (no more disk full): 20 PRs treated and merged
      * BOM uses (pods) container with their workspace as emptyDir as expected
      * But the AWS Kubernetes nodes has a disk of only 20Gb which was filled => increased to 200 Gb (and better IOPS for free)
      * Study to eventualy decrease to a lower size (90 Gb) taking in account the 3 pods / node rule, to decrease the cost (storage based)
      * Eventually define /tmp and the Jenkins home as emptyDir

          * Credential (Azure vault) endpoints
  * [Apply to Docker Open Source for the `jenkinsciinfra` and `jenkins4eval` organizations](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3452)
      * Damien to send email
      * If not possible, `jenkinsciinfra` could move to GHCR (GitHub registry)
          * Pros: better RBAC (managed per repository)
          * Risk: Rate Limit/ Costs in GHCR
      * `jenkins4eval` : same (GHCR ?). Let's ask the contributors
  * [Sunset the `robobutler` service](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3437)
