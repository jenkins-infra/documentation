## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/104?closed=1):
  * [plugin-site build is failing](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3999)
      * Due to an agent template change on infra.ci.jenkins.io last week, deployment started to fail
      * Root cause: the new agents (Linux arm64 VM instead of x86 pod templates) weren't allowed to access the production file share through their network
      * Fixed and green
      * Post-mortem: monitor these jobs using reports.jenkins.io with information that could be public (job name, status and last date) combined with datadog probe to detect last build time and status to alert us if failing or not run since X minutes/ Y hours. See the "monitor private instances" task below
  * [SSL certificate on ci.jenkins.io and assets.ci.jenkins.io expires 28 Mar 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3998)
      * Root cause: as each VM migration, our old puppet module for Letsencrypt creates a new account and fail because only 1 is needed
      * Fixed it manually (with details on the issue)
      * Post-mortem: monitoring certificate ages with datadog/pagerduty (instead of waiting for Mark)
  * [Delete Jira `VERTEST` project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3995)

      * We took the opportunity to bump falco (security) and nginx (ingress) charts as part of the operation
      * Kubernetes 1.28 issue + planning for next week: @smerle 
  * [Mirror in Singapore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2901)
      * Close to Servana: spreading the workload in Asia between both
