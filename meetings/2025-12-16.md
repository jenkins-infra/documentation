2. Announcements:
    * Jenkins Digicert Code Signing Certificate expires in 4 months: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3323

        * Try a GitHub project in packaging repository

    * After pkg.origin.jenkins.io migration to Azure, we should renew GPG key before March 2026 so we could insert it in January LTS release
        * Previous renewal: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3457#issuecomment-1485124225
        * infra team is autonomous to renew it, but this requires extended communication
