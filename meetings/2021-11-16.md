## Notes :book:

* Certificate Renewal for repo.jenkins-ci.org
  * email from KK
  * Thanks @MarkEWaite 
  * Jfrog issue is in progress

* Kubernetes/Helm Charts
  * Huge work from @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ on cleaning up file structure, tracking more dependencies
  * WiP on updatecli for docker images (helm-chart tracking is already done)
  * ⚠️ Issue with helm 3.7.x and the keycloak chart: https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/issues/504. Avoid upgrading the docker-helmfile until the keycloak chart is fixed: https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/pull/505
  * Reviewing the Docker update definitions in updatecli

* DNS renewal of jenkins-ci.org domain
    * Expires in 51 days
    * Tyler Croy has automated renewal, if less than 30 days, ask Tyler

* Infra Costs
  * EC2: 
      * might be below the 10k bar this month. Spot agents very effective.
      * Should we start moving pkg.jenkins.io VM from EC2 to oracle (bandwidth 3k€)?
          * Split into two machines for two services it provides
          * Azure would be easier, but must check bandwidth cost
          * If bandwidth too expensive, consider Oracle cloud
              * Could use ARM64 server instead of AMD64 for lower cost
  * Azure:
      * Stable at 8k€ (below the 10k€ limit from CDF)
      * to do: spot instances for azure vm agents
  * New providers:
      * WiP on "Librarizing" the Terraform tasks
      * Then we can start [Digital Ocean](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3102) and [Scaleway](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3122)
      * k3s: [recycle the 2 OSUSL machines](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3103) + WDYT about CivoCloud?
      * @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ has a proposal with a managed Nomad
          * [Squarescale.com](https://www.squarescale.com/)
          * Needs experimentation to confirm viability
      * Met in last few months with CivoCloud representatives (Saiyam Patak)
          * Fast provisioning of Kubernetes clusters

* Kubernetes 1.20 upgrade
  * Next major task for @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ 
      * Upgrading public for services and Amazon EKS for ci.jenkins.io agents
 
* Others
  * Thanks @MarkEWaite for s390x label and JCasC label update
  * Puppet cleanup WiP
      * Current tests are no value, require VirtualBox
      * Puppet upgrade would allow management of more machines (ppc, arm, s390x)

* CDF 2022 budget
    * CDF TOC members are also part of CDF governance
    * December discussions of budgets for next year
    * Azure sponsorship has been requested by CDF
        * If approved, would be large savings for Jenkins and CDF
    * CDF would like to consolidate billing accounts

* Linux Foundation expects their GitHub account is owner for all organizations under the Linux Foundation
    * Required for new projects in the Linux Foundation
    * How do they make that request?
    * How do we assess the risk from that change?
    * How does it compare with current Jenkins security processes?
    * Needs discussion with security team and governance board
        * Negotiate, develop a plan, etc.
