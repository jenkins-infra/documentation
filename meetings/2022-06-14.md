  * [[ci.jenkins.io] Provides powershell on the Windows Docker images used on ACI](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2974)
      * Tricky issue as both `pwsh` and `powershell` are valid
      * Issue to be raised to the pipeline plugin implementing the 2 steps `pwsh` and `powershell`: feature request to have auto-detection
      * As per @lemeurherve 's feedback: we have to update our pipeline-library to use `pwsh` (or `bat` as fallback like Jesse and James did) instead of `powershell` to avoid errors with our nanoserver agents
  * [[JENKINS-49707] Evaluate retry to improve the stability of the builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2984)
      * Feedback to do in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/405 to Jesse about "usage"
      * As per <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2984#issuecomment-1154795568, we rolled it out on infra.ci earlier today. Le'ts wait and see how it behaves (focus: what happens when controller restart with kubernetes-management pod agents + check for failing VM agents when the agent process is done, like it would with reclaimed spot VMs)
      * Raised by @lemeurherve : comment from Jesse to check (and eventually answer) https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-jenkins-weekly/pull/512#pullrequestreview-1005900734
  * [Auto notify people based on service routing rules](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2827)

* New/Important [`infra-team-sync-next`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10)
  * [‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback JDK8 removal for the 2.346 LTS upcoming line] 
      * @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag to open an issue for this
      * @dduportal ready to work on it as he already did the same kind of rollback on 2.332 line for upcoming security releases
  * [Maven 3.8.6 upgrade campaign ci.jenkins.io ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2986)
      * Waiting for Daniel Beck's go (ref. security release)
  * [Replace s390x Ubuntu 18.04 agent with s390x Ubuntu 20.04 agent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2983)
      * Mark takes it
      * Low priority
      * As discussed end of meeting: outages for the s390x and powerpc agents does not justify updating status.jenkins.io: tt only bothers the infra team, not other users.
  * [enable Development integration in JIRA](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2985)
      * Legit request
      * Require a technical user in jenkinsci, dedicated for this as we need oauth
