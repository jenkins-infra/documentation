  * [Increase disk space for systempool on privatek8s](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3539)
      * Changing this resource require destroy/recreate of the cluster :(
      * Let's start moving "app" workload to decrease disk usage

      * 3 (empty) VMs in the same networks (bounce, controller and permanent) / subnet
      * Next: work on security groups, and then start preparing the migration data

      * Python + launchable installed on the windows ACI's nanoserver images, but has errors on runtime and does not work with launchable alone :'(
      * Working around missing DLLs, trying to get them from windows server core but looks like a rabbit hole
      * Let's check with Basil with the current state if it works, otherwise we'll have to use windows server core as base image
  * [Artifact caching proxy is unreliable](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3481)
      * With the new inbound azure VM feature, we should be able to migrate ci.jenkins.io ephemeral agents to the ACP network
  * [AKS: add cluster `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3351)

      * Next step for infra.ci: remove AWS arm64 template
