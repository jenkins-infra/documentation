## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.506 succesfully released the 15 April 2025 with no issues - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$Uwx_V2kL-a2fZOPYk56fYcncflev6hRpkap4oo_gqaU?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
    * This week: 2.507, started on time - 
2. Team availabilities

    * StÃ©phane is off next week (28 April -> 02 May) and the Wednesday 7 May
    * 1, 8 and 29 May are banking holidays for Bruno, Stephane and Damien as well
3. Announcements:
    * DigitalOcean Emergency Core Infrastucture today (Start: 2025-04-22 13:00 UTC End: 2025-04-22 19:00 UTC).
        * No digitalocean API call (Terraform project jenkins-infra/digitalocean => new puppet master and weekly.ci new VM, eventually archives.jenkins.io)
    * Kubernetes Upgrade (1.30 -> 1.31) on `publick8s` this Thurday 24 April (07:30am UTC, 09:30am Paris)
        * No objection: let's roll
    * Adoptium JDK trimestrial upgrade on the 4 JDKs we use (8,11,17 and 21): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4642
    * JDK25 incoming
        * Subject tracked by Bruno and Kris, [helpdesk issue opened by Bruno](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4641), thanks!
        * We have to:
            * Add the JDK25 in agents (all in on image)
            * Add the JDK25 in jenkins tools (all controllers)
            * Pipeline library
        * Timeline: ETA in May for infra
        * JDK21 as runtime for controllers: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4623
    * Ubuntu 20.04 is being dropped
        * Ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2982#issuecomment-2820865761
        * Why not Ubuntu 24.04? Because of `curl` issue still present: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2982. 22.04 is supported until April 2027: we're good for now.
        * GitHub Actions runners => `ubuntu-latest` or pin to a version? => since it is only a GitHub action so no `curl` or no `arm64` case
        * Puppet (6.x) Master machine (Azure and DO) with Puppet in a 20.04 container while using recent Ubuntu (22.04)?
    * Shall we archive the [Jenkins Infra Windows Agents Container Images](jenkins-infra/docker-inbound-agents)?
        * Not used anymore since https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4554
        * It is an edge case of the https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/blob/master/vars/buildDockerAndPublishImage.groovy pipeline library
        * Less configuration and less builds
    * ci.jenkins.io in Azure
        * Let's check https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/154
        * BOM: we need support bundle (is plugin still there: no. Need to add it back.)
        * Billing: looks good on Azure.
    * AWS did sent us a form to apply for more sponsorship
        * Mark and Damien work on this as it is very welcomed
    * Incoming Software Update Campaigns (issues to create):
        * JDK April patches (see above)
        * Nginx Ingress 4.12 (ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/kubernetes-management/pull/6354): grouping with Kube 1.31?
        * Mirrorbits 0.5 -> 0.6: issue to create, first bumped version since 6 years, could impact (but improve) both Update Center and get.jenkins.io
        * Docker CE 28.0.x -> 28.1.x: PR ready, will be applied to VMs when rebooting for this week upgrades
        * ASDF 0.16.x: issue to create, PRs ready, should be an easy one (be careful: need tests before deploying)
            * Deprecating docker-builder (websites) in favor of the all in one image?
        * JQ 1.7: issue to create, mostly impacts report generations, UC and RPU
        * Chocolatey 2.x in the all in one image
