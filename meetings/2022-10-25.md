  * [[ci.jenkins.io] collect datadog metrics for ephemeral VMs](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2980)
  * [Artifactory Log-in no longer working](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3191)
  * [Chore: Swap GH permission level](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/pull/3188)
  * [Modifications to the Developers group](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3185)
  * [Delete account on accounts.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3175)
  * [RPM1004: Error retrieving metadata: Not Found](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3183)
    * User confirmed their problem was solved
  * [Downloading Jenkings LTS (msi package) is too slow](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3196)
    * Problem fixed, clsoing in favor of [Jenkins Mirror](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3182)
  * [Can't get email for the password](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3174)
      * Closing as no feedback from user

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/39):
  * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.23](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3053)
      * Digital Ocean (2 clusters) :heavy_check_mark:
      * AWS EKS (2 clusters) :heavy_check_mark: but not easy (CSI volumes issues and then LB issues)
      * Todo: Azure AKS (2 clusters)
      * Broke the new artifact caching proxy on AWS (see below)
  * [Artifact downloads failed on agent using repo cache](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3203)
      * Partially caused by EKS 1.23 upgrade on `eks-public`. Removed the AWS repo in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/504 to allow continuing
      * Also, since Friday, some builds failed due to HTTP/504 errors from the caching proxies
      * Next steps:
          * Improve selection of available repo caches in the future (we'll have to dynamically change environment variables instead of using static code in pipeline-library)
          * We'll have to enable datadog logs and metrics on ACP to diagnose the HTTP/504
          * Add a fallback capability in the pipeline-library (check if the local repo cache is available otherwise use JFrog), which requires a healthcheck system in the ACP system
          * (Maybe) Set replication of ACP pods to 2
  * [Update center json returning 404](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3161)
      * Nothing done (not enough time)
  * [(Re) Introduce an artifact caching proxy for ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2752)
  * [Archive a few Jira components](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3192)
      * Damien to do it because of JIRA admin
  * [Windows ACI 11 agent broken: no `git` found](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3189)
  * [Jenkins Mirror](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3182)
      * Requester acknowledged: waiting for them
  * [Publish `pipeline-steps-doc-generator` and `backend-extension-indexer` artifacts to some kind of storage](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3087)
      * Tools OK, but OOM on one of the builds
      * next step: publish artefacts on reports.jenkins.io (and try new JDK11 to avoid OOM)
  * [https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/job/stories/ is not handling PRs](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3157)
      * Requirements defined: gotta implement (pipeline writing)
  * [[INFRA-2754] Realign repo.jenkins-ci.org mission](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2322)
      * Todo (nothing done yet)
  * [Windows agents are soooooooooo slooooooooooooooooooow](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3117)
      * Back to backlog, unless we have time to work on it
  * [Keycloak performance horrific when looking up / modifying users](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2915)
      * Delayed, waiting for kube 1.23 upgrade being finished
  * [https://twitter.com/jenkins_release is many weeks behind](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3085)
      * Created the helmchart
          * Secret definition
          * Tested on eks-public :heavy_check_mark: 
      * Then ready to deploy on production

* [New/Important](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10):
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3204 => no action for infra-team for now (RFE for accountapp)
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3200 => added to current milestone + add an issue to add template for account password recovery (as per @lemeurherve 's idea)
    * [[From Platform SIG] Remove PPC64 mentions on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3198) => added to current milestone
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3194 => to be updated with EIP experiment for DNS update
    * [Access to npm namespace](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3067) => added to current milestone
    * [Add observability for the build agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2769)
        * Kept in backlog, but might be interesting to build a custom Grafan stack scoped to ci.jenkins.io (hacktoberfest?)
