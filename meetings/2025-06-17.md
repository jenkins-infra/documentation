## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.514 - successful release: https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$uqsC62Cs00Il1MDENIufCtHxeHJSQVTWR3k4G8UQ7jY?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
        * Built with JDK21 and Maven 3.9.10
    * This Week: 2.515 - started on time: https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$7Y2GYszdIaJ6jhjjbUXxE-Wq4K0PjbkAfJO5oZ-oBtI?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org 
2. Announcements:
    * Git 2.50.0 (Windows long path \o/)
    * Docker Windows failures on ci.jenkins.io since a few days: let's watch weekly release carefully
    * New contributor to the infra: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/4188#event-18182755858
    * jenkinsistheway.io domain is not ours: Should we try to rebuy it?
        * If no, then we have to cleanup a bit: removing DNS zone + records, decomission the Kubernetes redirector service (and the httpredirector chart)
        * General Board task: CDF should own the Jenkins domains
            * jenkinsistheway.io => it's been a long time. Let's decommission! (search source code to update links) => @dduportal create issue for decommission
            * Action item for domains jenkins.io and jenkins-ci.org which are owned by Tyler, to transfer it to CDF/LF => @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag

## Upcoming Calendar ðŸ“†

* Next Weekly: 2025-06-24: 2.516
* Next LTS: 2025-06-25, 2.504.3, Philipp Glanz is the release lead, ref. https://www.jenkins.io/events/
* Next Security Release as per [jenkinsci-advisories](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories): N.A.
* Upcoming credentials expirations (~3 weeks):
    * 2025-07-06:
        * (Issue to create)- Azure SP used for `updatecli` jobs in infra.ci: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/pull/1063
        * (Issue(s) to create)- Azure SP used to deploy websites to production from trusted.ci (into file shares):
            * www.jenkins.io: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/pull/1062
            * javadoc.jenkins.io: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/pull/1061
            * :warning: :bulb: good candidate for moving to a credential-less by using ephemeral VM agent assigned identity (trusted.ci is NOT multi tenant)
        * (Issue to create)- Azure SP used to deploy websites to production from infra.ci (into file shares):
            * docs.jenkins.io: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/pull/1059

            * :warning: :bulb: good candidate for moving to a credential-less workload identity. Jenkins Azure plugin do not support it (yet) as per https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4651 BUT this one is a direct pod -> Azure File Storage thing so it should work well.
