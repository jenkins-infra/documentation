    * [Update ci.jenkins.io, trusted.ci, cert.ci and release.ci to latest LTS version 2.452.1](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4097)
    * [Grant public visibility on ` GSoC 2024 - OpenRewrite` GitHub project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4094)
    * [[wiki (docker-confluence-data) deprecated updatecli manifest](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4093)
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io / accountapp] Build stuck waiting for `jdk17` label](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4070)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/112?closed=1):

    * [retrieve my id and password](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4098)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/112):
    * [[ci.jenkins.io] Migrate ci.jenkins.io EKS clusters out from CloudBees AWS account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3954)
        * Successfully migrated (EKS + DigitalOcean) to Azure. Bills shows it does what we want, and no error on ci.jio
        * Cleanup in progress
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Proposal by @smerle for the production opening: add 1-2 mirrors on the currently unused OSUOSL VMs we have
            * We have to ask OSUOSL => @dduportal (+ ask about the OSUOSL mirrors slowness when syncing)
            * Enough storage? => @smerle to check
            * But we keep the plan of adding a 2nd Cloudflare in US though (to spread workloads) => @smerle 
        * WiP: update-center2 to populate the distincts webservices => @dduportal 
    * [migrate storage from premium to standard for jenkins-infra, jenkins-weekly and jenkins-release](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4044)
        * WiP:
            * Changed the plan: we will define disk, PV and PVC as code (static provisionning of storage, instead of dynamic with ony PVC)
            * weekly.ci is the first target, @smerle will create resources when he's back Thursday. Plan for real migration to be detailled but looks good (including migration)
                * @dduportal to check the latest (draft) PR
        * Next steps:
            * infra.ci and release.ci
    * [Packer-Images: bug within updatecli to update goss since exclusion of windows 2019 for vsstudio](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4090)
        * "updatecli" process is broken since introduction of VSCode 2019, we wern't able to release new container image since 4 weeks due to this
        * Root problem identified and required 2 steps:
            * Done: Manifests short term fix, we receieved (and emerged) 38 PRs, image released and deployed
            * WiP: Fixing the goss testing system for VSCode 2019 (by @smerle)

    * [packer-images: git version not always available simultaneously on apt ppa for arm64 and amd](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4100)
        * Another issue which delayed the agent image of a few days: the Git version between Windows, Ubuntu x86_64 and arm64 where ALL different!
            * As such, delivering the fixed CVEs on `git` is again an issue
        * Version upgraded and delivered
        * WiP: we are trying to switch to compiling git ourselves on Linux
            * Works fast and easy
            * Currently cleaning up + trying to check for explicit dependencies `git`
            * Tests to add to make this safer for the future
            * Todo: updatecli to update git source version
 

    * Stuck issues (e.g. no work done but keep in upcoming milestone)
        * [Add `.war.asc` to get.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4055)
