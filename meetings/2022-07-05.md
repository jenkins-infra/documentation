## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly: 2.359 is published in artifactory + artifactory. Checklist not (yet) complete but no issues detected
  * Further adoption on the JDK/JS/dependencies that *might* introduces instabilities. Be warned for infra.ci.jenkins.io
  * Next weekly will have a Jetty 9 -> 10 upgrade. Major update on a key component.
2. Start using JDK17 on our weekly instances (infra.ci and weekly.ci)
  * No known issues
  * Challenge for agents: we need to update Docker images to have both JDK11 and JDK17 (VM already have)
