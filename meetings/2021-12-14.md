## Notes :book:

* Accelerating ci.jenkins.io build and test with Gradle Enterprise - @MarkEWaite
    * Etienne Studer of Gradle Enterprise to discuss infrastructure needs
        * Concepts
            * Reducing time to evaluate a change
            * Reducing time to complete a fix
            * Reduce failures related to duplicate work
        * Collects information from builds and tests while they are running
            * Can be done for local builds and CI builds
            * More than log capture and log analysis
            * Root cause analysis use deeper insights
            * Improve collaboration between people assessing issues
            * CI issue investigation possible without requiring infra team
                * A new dependency pulled into the build
            * Smaller issues can be addressed efficiently
        * Build scan that captures details about the build
            * xwiki example to see dependencies and shareable analysis
                * [Example](https://ge.xwiki.org/s/kdskfq5gypi7q/dependencies?toggled=WyIwLjEtMS4wIiwiMS0yLTEwOC00MTkiLCIwLjAiLCIwLjAtMS4wIiwiMC0yLTEtMiIsIjAtMi0xLTItMi0zIl0) available publicly
        * Faster feedback cycles, CI and locally
            * Faster build improves many different areas
            * Reduce overhead for new contributors (faster startup)
            * Spring boot example - don't do work we've done already
                * Reduced spring boot build from 40 minutes to 2 minutes
            * Reduce CI resource use
                * Skip goals because results are already cached
                * Skip tests that are unaffected by the change
                * Faster local builds create less demand on CI build
                    * Fast local build instead of "let CI check it"
            * Reduce the rerun pattern with fewer flaky builds
            * Spring boot build reports flaky tests to show most flaky
                * Shows expensive tests and intermittent failing tests
            * CI pushes to the cache, while developers only read from cache
            * A pull and build can use the cache
                * Caching at the goal level for maven builds
            * Predictive test selection (pre-release)
                * Preview released this week, not yet production
                * Uses historic data rather than code traversal
        * Deployment
            * Deploys into a Kubernetes cluster
            * Supports external database
            * Multiple cache nodes and pre-emptive replication allowed
        * Configuring a project to use it
            * Add extensions.xml with Gradle Enterprise maven extension
                * extensions.xml
                * gradle-enterprise.xml
                * Build cache credentials added to CI to push to cache
    * Infrastructure team assess experiment plan, assess impact
        * 30 day GE trial process
            * Install and configure
            * Connect a build
            * Capture a baseline
            * Optimize performance
            * Quantify improvement
            * Present return on investment
        * Visualizations that show build cache use and build performance
            * Detect flaky builds
        * How to do it?
            * ge.jenkins.io prototype
                * 142 goals in 6 projects - 72 minutes
                * 142 goals in 6 projects - 2 minutes cached
        * Credentials on ci.jenkins.io considered compromised
            * Would we need to generate the cache elsewhere (staged)?
            * Will we get the same benefit from staged cache?
                * Benefit from local cache in all cases
                * Remote cache with less frequent publishing less benefit
                * May need two caches, one on AWS, one on Azure
            * Comparing cost of maintaining service vs. paying build?
                * Don't have cost estimates, used on AWS at their accounts
                * Costs are not so large for difference between them
                * Cache overhead much less than build/test cost
        * GE hosts 13 open source instances themselves
            * $130 per instance per month
        * Kubernetes cluster that hosts our services on one provider
            * Local cache possible? - yes
        * Kubernetes cluster that hosts ephemeral agents
            * Local cache possible? - yes
        * Can specific artifacts be removed from cache? - yes
            * Sometimes we have 0 byte artifacts written to cache
            * Cache key of the entry is available
            * Ask to delete the key from all nodes
    * Mark begin the conversations with governance board and developers
    * Mark schedule a developer online meetup to share the experience
        * Etienne present to the meetup
        * Mark to schedule with Etienne

* Log4Shell - [CVE-2021-44228](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67353)
    * Thanks to Herve, Mark for infrastructure work on CVE
    * Accounts.jenkins.io: put it back
        * Which additional measures (java version, java opts, log4j)?
    * Replace account.jenkins.io by admin/beta (e.g. keycloak)
        * What is left to do?
            * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2835 ?
            * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67326
            * Others?
        * Running inside a Docker container (jetty:jre8)
            * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/account-app/blob/master/Dockerfile#L1
                * Running jdk 8u232 inside accounts.jenkins.io
            * Stephane run the Docker scan of beta.accounts.jenkins.io
            * Mark run the Docker scan of accounts.jenkins.io
                * Read the tag defined on the chart image
                * Confirm the SHA checksum matches described pod
                * jenkinsciinfra/account-app:169-buildca55e3
                    * The docker scan listed 6 known issues
                        * None of them were log4j2
                        * Confirmed SHA from kubernetes matches pulled SHA
    * Applications are running currently, without ingress
        * Account-app:
            * https://accounts.jenkins.io no ingress
        * Keycloak:
            * [Keycloak isn't vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/9078)
            * https://beta.accounts.jenkins no ingress
            * https://admin.accounts.jenkins.io ingress through private VPN
    * Additional mitigation measures
        * Kubernetes scanning?
        * Kubernetes Ingress rule + Apache rule to forbid requests with the infamous JNDI in headers and URLs?
            * deny listing by words might be complicated: https://github.com/Puliczek/CVE-2021-44228-PoC-log4j-bypass-words
            * most of the headers are vulnerables ([source with mitigations instructions](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/log4j-vulnerability-remediation-with-waf-and-ips-cve-2021-44228)): 
              > Request headers include but are not limited to X-Api-Version, User-Agent, Cookie, Referer, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, Upgrade-Insecure-Requests, Accept, Origin, Pragma, and Content-Type. Note that some public PoC exploit scripts send payload in only the X-Api-Version header, but other headers can be used for exploitation.
             * not worth the effort to implement header checks
        * Others?
            * From https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/
              > Kubernetes administrators may use ‚Äúkubectl set env‚Äù to set the LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=‚Äútrue‚Äù environment variable to apply the mitigation across Kubernetes clusters where the Java applications are running Log4j 2.10 to 2.14.1, effectively reflecting on all pods and containers automatically.
            * Not valuable since we've not found log4j2 in any images
    * Team agrees that accounts.jenkins.io and beta.accounts.jenkins.io
        * Ask security team for their agreement
        * Not ready to bring online until tomorrow
