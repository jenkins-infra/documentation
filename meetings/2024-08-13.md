* [Work in progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/122):
    * [Vandalism in Jira](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4229)
        * New pattern in JIRA vandalism on the past 8 days :(
        * Generate a LOT of work for us (see how much issues Mark did treat to block users and revert their changes in JIRA)
        * We had to enable the circuit-breaker on account.jenkins.io, leading to a lot of users issues (unable to create there accounts)
        * After 2 days of circuit breaker, vandalism came back again :( . So re-enabled for 1-2 days again
        * Short term:
            * Wip on blocking the email adress (as we saw multiple account using consistently the same email). But might not protect us if email changes often. At least for this one.
            * Abuse report sent to Google for this account
            * Let's also check public IP and eventually block it if it is constant
        * All changes in JIRA have been rollbacked (at least the "sufficient" ones - issue state changes or comments)
        * Medium term: switching away from accounts.jenkins.io (ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2232)
            * Adding user registration steps to make automation more difficult (captcha, email validation, etc.)
    * [Cannot signup in jenkins](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4235)
    * [I've been blocked](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4230)
    * [Suspend distribution of the windows-slaves-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4221)
        * Discussion in progress in the UC PR, going in the right direction
    * [Bad gateway message fails some ci.jenkins.io builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4204)
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Builds stuck due to GH API rate limit](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4165)
        * Next step : create distinct GH apps
    * [[Plugin Health Score] Scores not computed - Getting logs from plugin-health.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4152)
        * Still on hold (Spring Security work takes Adrien time)
    * [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * Jay is working on Windows inbound and infra.ci
        * Damien works on the SSH Windows agents
    * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
        * Still LDAP to reproduce (need to bump versions and OS of the image)
        * Let's merge the x86 node pools
    * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)
        * Done azure-net 
        * As discussed team-wide: we do NOT want to move existing GHA updateclis to Jenkins (unless it is private Jenkins infra stuff)
        * Scope: Terraform Infra jobs.
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Controllers are using it \o/
        * Mark had infinite loop when checking with webbrowser
            * Fixed \o/

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/123)
  * [plugin stats for bouncycastle-api are missing data.](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4213) => looks like a duplicate of 3815
