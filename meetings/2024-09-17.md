                * It's 2024: should be the good path
                * But if we can avoid "surprise breakage" for users, time to communicate properly (admin monitors, blog posts, etc.)

## Hacktoberfest

Proposal to remove all `hacktoberfest` labels so participation would be really explicit and volunteer

Discussion: SIG Infra should not participate unless we find obvious easy issue but we don't seem to have which won't have team spending time on it.
Better to help other SIGs in a controlled effort.

## Action Points :muscle:
