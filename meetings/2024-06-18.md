    * [Add `bstopp` to `adobe-cloud-manager-plugin` repo team: `jenkinsci/adobe-cloud-manager-plugin-developers`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4137)
    * [Update development team for scm-manager-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4136)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/116?closed=1): none

* [Work in progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/116):
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Delaying to next week until we get a feedback from JenSec team
    * [Streamline Maven versions across the infrastructure](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4110)
        * Release is ok
        * Todo: trusted.ci and puppet (light changes)
    * [Switch Jenkins Weekly Core Release to drop JDK11](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4135)
        * Release in progress, JDK17 is there
        * Issue will be closed once release finished
        * we went on JDK17 instead JDK21
    * [Add a new private kubernetes cluster in the new sponsored azure subscription](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3923)
        * New cluster created and managed by our system
        * WiP: setting up infra.ci.jenkins.io to use this cluster for agents (see details in issue)
        * Issue will be closed only when we stop using privatek8s
        * Note: when we'll reach end of the Azure sponsored credits, we'll go back to current state in privatek8s
    * [To host https://github.com/shlomomdahan/stats.jenkins.io/ docs in jenkins-infra for GSoC 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4132)
        * GSoc project as well
        * Project has CI working + pull request Netlify previews + permissions on GH
        * Next steps:
            * Split infra.ci job into 2: one for deployment and one for PRs (to allow non repository maintainers to be allowed to have their preview site)
                * Allows enabling GH check feedback for PRs (but not for main deployment)
                * Also allows separating credentials (fileshare only for admins, netflify credential is less critical)
            * Using Docker image (like docker-confluence) instead of shared Azure fileshare (cost decrease)?
                * We start with file share for now: quicker to get started. Standard: let's watch the budget
    * [ACP timing out](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4134)
        * ACP errors on builds lately
        * 2 kinds: 
            * HTTP/502, related to DNS issues (internally) => should not happen anymore (Azure Linux DNS client behaves better than Ubuntu)
            * Timeout requests. No errors seen on network, ACP or Kubernetes. No dropped conenction on ACP as per datadog. Can be client-side error, or whole.
        * We haven't seen any more error for now: let's watch until next week.
    * [Cannot publish my plugin anymore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4133)
        * Not an infrastructure problem (proved in the issue) but more a project (pom.xml/parent/incrementals) misconfiguration or misuage
        * @MarkEWaite takes the lead on this one as it is communication with developers
    
    * [Move the jenkins-stats repositories to the jenkins-infra organization](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4017)
        * Work triggered by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/contributor-spotlight/pull/141 (source of truth owned by non jenkins GH organization)
        * Migrating repositories had side effects (see new issues from JMM) => @Herve takes care of these
    * [migrate storage from premium to standard for jenkins-infra, jenkins-weekly and jenkins-release](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4044)
        * Was on hold
        * WiP on the upcoming milestone
    * [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * Linux (inbound + SSH) are ready to go
        * Windows inbound: thanks to Tim's pointer, we have an easy solution with the winsx system
        * Next step: check a solution for Windows SSH agents
        * Then: code and deploy
    * [[reports.jenkins.io][infrastructure data API] Add outbound IPs for get.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4114)
        * WiP: shell portability
        * Next step: add get.jenkins.io section for outbound IPs

* [ToDo (next milestone)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/117)

    * Service Principal used by infra.ci.jenkins.io to spawn Azure agents expires on 2024-06-30 => issue to create
    * Cloudflare API + R2 token are expiring July 2 => issue to create
    * JIRA project INFRA:
        * 2 issues with assignement changed=> spam? (discussion: not this time but might if they flood us)
        * Should we archive the INFRA project? (Daniel tried but seems like high effort) or eventually manage permissions to only allow read-only except for administrators?
    * Issues by JMM about contributor-stats
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4143
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4142

        * They are switching to a new system name "LFX insights"
        * They need help on setting it up with our organizations and ask for a meeting
            * We need one admin of each Gh admin
            * Corresponding team to ping jenkinsci admins in helpdesk issues: https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/teams/jenkinsci-admins
