## Notes :book:

* Hacktoberfest infrastructure Newbie friendly issues - [link](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3074?jql=project%20%3D%20INFRA%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly)
* New Jenkins infrastructure calendar
    * Track deadlines (certificate expiry. etc.)
    * Intentionally not a public calendar
    * Main events should go to the public Jenkins calendar
* Repository jenkins-infra/confluence-data
    * Confluence service will not come back
    * Don't want to lose confluence data
        * Conversion to jenkins.io site
    * All pages exported to HTML in a private Git repository
        * Remains private in case of sensitive information
    * If you want to assist with migration, ask for access
    * Next steps
        * Alternatives
            * Deploy a static web site mapping content
            * Might consider nginx [try_files](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#try_files) directive
                * Handle character mapping guesses
	* How to validate  that it doesn't contain sensitive information?
	    * Useful to have as much public as posible (contributions, hacktoberfest, wiki export sometimes missing content)
	* Starting with a list of "URLs" to the old wiki to get started
	    * There are a few in jenkins.io to extract
	    * Provides healthcheck for the new images, and a "definition of done"
	    * these pages should not have any sensitive content
     
* Issues with agents on ci.jenkins.io
	* ruby agent
	* maven-11-windows somehow has issues
	    * Will check XML files on ci.jenkins.io
	    * Will restart ci.jenkins.io to check persistence
	    * Will manually modify single cloud per container
	    * check casc config (a field might not be filled) + XML also
    * maven-11
        * Kubernetes sizing to improve (right now: 4 cpus per pod, worker have 8 cpus, and only 7 available for orchestrator, so limit of 50 pods at the same time.)
* accounts.jenkins.io
