## Attendees

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Security update tomorrow: don't merge anything tomorrow morning that could mess it!


## Notes :book:

* Weekly release 2.329 unexpectedly triggered
  * Issue tracking the problem to avoid reproduction
  * Still the same issue: Manually disabling == not persistent
      * Don't configure interactively without a matching code change
  * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2727

* Weekly package failed on Windows step:
  * Need to "merge" the 2 windows containers into a single one @dduportal to secure tomorrow's release
      * Latest kubernetes plugin is not enough to allow multi-container on Windows
          * @dduportal plans to work that issue today
          * Discuss with security team before applying the change
          * Check the differences between weekly and LTS branches
      * Remove the branching for the release repository and the packaging repository
          * Switch to a file per release line in a single branch of the repository

* [Issues for INFRA are now in GitHub](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/9) thanks to @lemeurherve
  * Previously:
      * Was in Jira's project INFRA
      * Followed the same idea as what @timja drove for the HOSTING project
      * Jira is slow, user hostile, not automatable easily, and slows/block our ability to track and share progress in a written + async manner
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è New repo: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk
  * Jira issues from INFRA projects imported
      * Component/tags migrated with labels (from existing jira labels & components)
  * Repository Pinned on the GitHub organization [jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra)
  * Work in progress:
      * Update infra docs (jenkins.io + repo + organization description)
      * Comment all jira issues in INFRA to add a link to their github counterpart
      * Update Jira issue wizard to add a link to the infra helpdesk for infra-related tasks
      * Announce the change on the different channels
  * Next:
      * [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/projects/5)
      * Automation (issues workflows)
      * [Backups of issues outside GitHub](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2722)

* AliBaba for mirror
    * No response to Mark Waite's question about physical location of the server
    * Mark Waite's monitoring shows no issue with that mirror
        * Last failures detected briefly 9 Jan 2022, 5 Jan 2022, 4 Jan 2022
        * Recovered without intervention from us

<!-- Delayed to next week meeting
* Work on the private cluster
* infra.ci's credentials

* ci.jenkins.io timeouts for aws-secrets-manager-secret-source & aws-secrets-manager-credentials-provider plugins
    * https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/h6klfdeM8tM
* Certificate for repo-ci.jenkins.org updated (thanks KK :hearth:)
* Netlify for plugins.jenkins.io, status.jenkins.io and jenkins.io
* rating.jenkins.io: The apache version + OS is shown by rating.jenkins.io
* census.jenkins.io: Damien *still* has to ask Tyler/Olivier about the "what does it do?"
* Day 2 day operations:
  * Disable anti spam for cert team: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3162
  * Move ci.jenkins.io auth (since matrix-auth-plugin 3.0) config to CasC: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3167
