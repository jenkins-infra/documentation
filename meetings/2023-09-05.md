      * PR proposed with a workaround to contributor, waiting for feedback

      * Container Image

      * WiP on the MySQL managed instance in Azure
  * [JDK21: change from nightly builds to weekly `ea` builds in the infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3736)
      * packer-image is now using JDK21 `ea` in production (version 1.24.0 of the template)
      * wip on the puppet (jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra), we had to improve our communication loop but now ready to roll

      * We can now build Linux multiplatform docker images for our own infra images, using docker bake like the jenkins official images
      * The wiki.jenkins.io is now served with arm64
      * Next step: lest list the remaining services to migrate
  * [Remove remnant of the legacy (overlapped) azure virtual networks](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3690)

      * Success on using a local rsyncd and a remote HTTP in CloudFlare bucket
          * moved rsync to private in Azure AKS but can be public if we add other mirrors somewhere else
      * Rsyncd container image is updated (wip) to harden it
      * WiP on splitting the current helm chart into 3 parts (mirrorbit, httpd server and rsyncd) to allows different deployment topologies
          * 3 subcharts + a "parent" helm
      * We did not receive any response from CloudFlare about sponsoring us as OSS project.
          * Let's target DigitalOcean mirror instead for the initial deployment:
            * Outbound bandwitdh cheap and we have credits
            * They asked us, as part of the sponsorship, to try their outbound bandwidth
          * Secondary potential mirrors: 
            * OVH (sponsorship to bootstrap but the outbound bandwitdh is free)
            * Oracle (we need a VM and a bit more work, but it would be on a US datacenter)
    * Plan the announcement on mailing lists and blog at least 2 weeks before the deployment, as this service will be served from different IP addresses (on allow lists)
  * [[`publick8s`] Ensure high availability of replicated services](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3719)
      * We want to work on this before adding more arm64 services in publick8s
