## Announcement :loudspeaker:

    * Release build restarted, running 90 minutes currently looking good for 
2. Security Plugin Advisory
    * https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-03-29/
3. Upcoming LTS 2.332.2
    * RC available for testing
    * Timeline: 6th of April

## Notes :book:

* weekly.ci.jenkins.io or design-library.jenkins.io?
    * Once June LTS is released, want it on ci.jenkins.io
    * Need it earlier for easy access
    * Kubernetes and similar configuration to infra.ci.jenkins.io
        * @timja opened a [helpdesk issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2855) so that we can start on it
* Done (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/7?closed=1)
    * [Sign up issues for Jenkins JIRA](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2815)

* WiP/Todo (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/8)
  * [Migrate ratings.jenkins.io from AWS to Azure](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/1627)
      * Done: PgSQL database in azure terraform (thanks @smerle @timja)
      * Todo: install the helm chart in prod then import existing data (@smerle)
  
  * [DockerHub API Rate Limit on VMs for ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2837)
    * [PR #333 on pipeline-library](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/333) by @smerle to spread the credentials (pull/push and per instance, no modulo in this PR)
    * Still todo: [contact Docker](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2842) @dduportal

  * [Email alias for press releases](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2786)
    * No answer from KK. Gotta contact mailgun (@dduportal?)

  * [Templatize the job definition list to generate DSL with per-folder/job credentials](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2840)
    * Blocks [Migrate infra-report from trusted.ci to infra.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2789)
    * WiP: helm template with all kind of credentials that we are using on infra.ci
    * ToDo: create a chart that insert the configmap with the correct label (almost there!)
        * fallback if not working: a big huge template to write in helmfile. But using helm is clearly better to open the road for a contrib (and template is already done in helm...)

  * [InfraCost](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2852)
      * Done: CLI installed, pipeline-library (almost ;) thanks to @lemeurherve
      * Azure and AWS are the only providers concerned for the moment (supported providers)
      * Use of 2 methods:
          * 1st recommended one: parsing the terraform plan
              * Only used for Azure as it doesn't contains the most sensible secrets
          * 2d experimental one: parsing HCL terraform manifests
              * No access to any sensible value
              * Used on AWS for now
              * Parity with the plan parsing is not assured, when it will all providers will use this method
      * Todo: evaluate first results
      * Call for contribution on their jenkins examples (empty)

  * [Git on Windows Agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2847)
      * Original issue: [set core.longpaths=true in all the windows containers used for builds ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2847)
      * Done: long paths in Windows tests problem solved in short term by [adding the corresponding git config in the `buildPlugin` shared pipeline](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/334)
      * The inclusion of this config has been started in the official `docker-agent` image in the jenkinsci organisation ([fix: enable long paths for git in Windows images](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/pull/239)), but would need to be propagated to another 2 jenkinsci repositories before being usable, so...
      * Todo: build our own Windows Docker images (instead of using `jenkins/agent*:windows*`)

  * [Monitor builds on our private Jenkins instances](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2843)
      * Mark has (Jenkins) RSS check for ci.jenkins.io: he'll check with Daniel if it is not exposing sensitive data.
      * If ok, then we'll try to reuse his work for this

  * Archera requirements: to be evaluated by the Security team
      * We didn't asked yet to review the IAM requirements Archera gave us
      * They don't seem to have any bandwidth available before April 14th

  * Digital Ocean sponsoring
      * The remaining credit on our account is around $1400
      * We consume ~$1000/month
      * Are we ready to ask them for an additional donation?
      * Need the blog post and logo on the web site before we ask
          * Mark and Herve pair on a blog post
