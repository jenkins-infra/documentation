              * Docker discussions to have all our organizations be part of the Docker open source program
                  * Could use other registries or a proxy
          * UI and logs were not being updated even though builds were proceeding
              * No errors, no warnings related to issue
          * Enlisting help from Basil to diagnose more deeply
          * Agent allocation failures, not agent disconnect
              * Both issues exist, but not necessarily related to each other
          * Basil thinks there were at least 5 different issues exposed during the outage
              * Willing to share that before our meeting to retrospect on the 
              * Attach it to the help desk issue

      * Packer + Tools OK
      * TODO: container agents
          * Community based containers may need update
          * Infra based containers need an update
  * [Add a email alias for press dns email mail] => blocked, waiting for LF
  * Memory analysis of core and PR builds
      * Improved observability of JVM options and their impacts
          * How much memory are we using in our builds
          * May be areas we can improve by adjusting memory configuration
          * Size our containers to better match our actual usage
              * If too large, save money by reducing size
              * If too small, increase reliability by increasing size
          * How is it being measured?
              * JVM prints settings with a command line flag, then collect data
              * Look at heap sizes of the JVM's as they are running
  * Improvements to the pipeline shared library
      * Allow use of the Maven wrapper call `mvnw` instead of `mvn`
          * Allows to download the expected Maven version (many benefits including allowing failures)
      * Two primary consumers - buildPlugin and Jenkins core
          * Allow consumers to adopt Maven build wrapper for consistent maven version in source code
          * Will it use a local maven if it finds the matching version locally (download avoidance)?
      * Basil can check the download

* New/Importants [`infra-team-sync-next`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10)
  * Add access for Basil to ci.jenkins.io (admin UI + VM) and datadog (JVM)
      * +1 from Mark Waite, Damien Duportal, Herve, Stephane, and Bruno
  * Crowdin work: SSO, DNS record, might be more requests to help this (new) translation system in the upcoming
  * Mirror in Singapore
  * Ping Alibaba about the status of their mirror in China
  * Change BlueOcean link
  * Build our own Windows Image
  * Sunset 

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/14)
