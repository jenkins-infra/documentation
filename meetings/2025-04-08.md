## Attendees ðŸ‘¥

<!-- Handles are community.jenkins.io handles -->

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* @smerle33 (StÃ©phane Merle)
* @kmartens27 (Kevin Martens)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Releases
    * Last Week (Security Advisory):
        * 2.492.3 LTS released with success.
        * 2.504 weekly released with success. Packaging jobs had to be aborted due to OSUOSL slowness during rsync, like 2.503 => to be watched on 2.505
    * This Week:
        * 2.505 started on time - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$tJ3z29RXPhw_kH17XLUx1BAOYF6Wdk2TFmJBfZjqHAo?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
            * Late revert by Mark Waite trying to avoid a change that breaks tests in plugin BOM
            * Later fix by Damien Duportal to fix a Pipeline syntax error
2. ci.jenkins.io migration from AWS to Azure: 2025-04-09 (tomorrow) at 09:00am UTC
    * Ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4620
3. Puppet GPG key expired: we cannot install puppet agent 6 or 7 anymore unless disabling GPG on their repository
    * Ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4631
    * Vagrant: fixed
    * Current VMs: only a warning message
    * New VMs: cloudinit to fix. Host the DEB package (`puppet-agent` for Bionic, Focal and Jammy) ourselves?
    * Puppet master: shall we try to install a new one in that case?
4. Warning about JDK17 EOL in 1 year
    * Ref. https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4623
    * Proposal to move the Docker image "latest" to JDK21: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/pull/2008 (ci.jenkins.io should use `lts-jdk17` so we are safe)
    * We already have many issues about this:
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4121
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4123
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4125
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4126
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4127
5. Team member days off:
    * Stephane off this week: from 9 (tomorrow) back Monday (14)
    * Damien is off next week (back on the office the 22)
        * We need someone to lead the team meeting => @smerle 
        * We need someone to ensure weekly release Docker image tag is created and pushed => @mark
    * Monday 21 April is banking day (Easter) in most of our countries
6. Note: Chinese website www.jenkins.io/zh will be back(?)
    * Let's move it to Netlify so the SIG doc can iterate with autonomy on it (until it is ready to redeploy)
7. DigitalOcean Core Infrastructure Maintenance 2025-04-14 
    * Status to add just in case
8. GitHub Milestones do not allow ordering of tasks: we must switch to GitHub projects to share priority
