## Notes :book:


* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/102?closed=1):
  * [Delete Jira bot issues and delete user](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3972)
  * [Improve robustness of CD toolchain](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3967)
      * Might result in some tokens not updated without us knowing: don't forget to check last RPU logs if it happens
  * [github CD process fails with 401 Unauthorized when deploying to https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3966)
      * Related to above (RPU build failed)
  * [Release of `jenkinsci/build-monitor-plugin` failing with 401 Unauthorized](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3962)
      * Related to above (RPU build failed)
  * [Export download mirrors list to a textual representation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3832)
      * New URL: https://reports.jenkins.io/infrastructure/v2/index.json 

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/102?closed=1):
  * [not able to download jenkins for windows](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3965)
  * [unable to login to page with the credentials used to create](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3960)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/102):
  * [Check if we could replace `blobxfer` by `azcopy`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414)
      * 3 main repositories (javadoc, jenkinsio and plugin-site) used `blobxfer` for deployment. All of them has been updated:
          * Storage accounts migrated (in production) to premium (mi. cost is ~20 / month)
          * New authentication (Azure SP + short lived SAS token) used for all
          * `azcopy` is used
      * Big benefit: upload time drastically decreased!
      * Next steps:
        * jenkins-infra/mirror-scripts (used by the PKG VM)
          * WiP work on Puppet setup to add azcopy and az CLI
          * Team decision to stay on the access key auth. system (as Azure SP would add too much overhead in this context)
        * Cleanups (older storage accounts to remove manually, etc.)
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * `azcopy` present, but `az` need to be installed on both agent.trusted and pkg VMs (see "next steps" above)
  * [Crawler fails due to lack of authentication](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3968)
      * SAS renewal done
      * Need to check the Cloudflare (S3) we renewed earlier this morning
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * WiP: Issue with some builds where `arm64` agent sizing was too small (OOM killed agents). 
          * Rabbit hole: bigger pod means bigger node pools which required a Kubernetes patch upgrade
          * for jenkins.io, let's use an ARM64 VM to fit with ci.jenkins.io (risk: unavailable images)
          * for account-app, better to check if not the same

  * [ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de blocked my provider](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3956)
      * Should be closeable: let's confirm the user is now unblocked
      * Let's open a distinct issue about the new mirror provider "Hostico" (:party:)
          * HTTP and sync ok, missing rsync or FTP for us to check in mirrorbits: almost there
  * [The UpdateCli step fails regularly when processing jenkins.io PRs](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3958)
      * To be addressed, not an easy one
  * [Exclude JB Space from ACP](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3973)
      * Alex already opened the PRs: looks good
  * [[plugin-health-scoring] Configure new job on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3961)
      * WiP, discussion in progress with Adrien. Goal is to decouple plugin site generation from plugin health (static files have better availability)
      
  * [Monitor builds on our private instances (trusted.ci.jenkins.io / infra.ci.jenkins.io / release.ci.jenkins.io)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2843)
      * Proposal done (draft) on https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/pull/62 which generates a complete JSON export
      * To be discussed: the Jenkins user token used to pull information from each controller (lifecycle, permissions on each controller, etc.)
      * Put on hold until we get a security feedback
  * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)
  * [[INFRA-3125] Migrate jenkins-infra repositories from branch "master" to "main"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2671)
  

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/103)
  * Kube 1.27: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3948
      * AWS planned this Thursday (7 March)
      * Azure planned the week of 19 March
