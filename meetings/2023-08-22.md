## Attendees ðŸ‘¥


<!-- Handles are community.jenkins.io handles -->
* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* @smerle33 (StÃ©phane Merle)
* @kmartens27 (Kevin Martens)
* @hlemeur (HervÃ© Le Meur)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly 2.419 - last week
2. Weekly 2.420 - today
  * Failure during test phase
  * Gotta check if it is infra issue (JDK17/resource limits) or maybe it's timeout
  * Let's restart the build and see
3. Rebuild the container images of jenkins for all Linux version on 2.401.1, 2.401.2, 2.401.3 and 2.419
  * A given tag is atomic (either all OS and platform) and must be rebuilt in the proper order (or at least ensure latest weekly is rebuilt last)
  * we can delete tags, but that would create other troubles
  * Ideally, weekly in bad shape would be solved by either using 2.419 or upcoming 2.420, or wait for the new LTS 2.414.1
  * Filtering by tag is not available in trusted.ci.jenkins.io

4. Java 21 support in Jenkins container image as "early access" lands today for weekly (2.420) and tomorrow for LTS (2.414.1)
  * Jenkins Infra will wait for official JDK21 release in Sept. before trying on controllers
 
## Upcoming Calendar ðŸ“†

* Next Weekly: 2.421 29 of August
* Next LTS: 2.414.1, the 23 of August
* Next Security Release as per [jenkinsci-advisories](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories): N.A.
* Next major event:
    * Jenkins elections start in September
        * Nomination of candidates (September 18 - October 27)
        * Voter registration (September 18 - November 05)
        * Voting (November 06 - December 1)
        * Results announcement (December 11)

## Notes :book:


* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/77?closed=1):

  * [Unable to release plugin 401](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3723)
      * Proposal from HervÃ©: [Add a comment on merged PRs to explain what's next and the time window](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater/issues/3494)
  * [Switch to JDK17 for Jenkins controllers and agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3072)
  * [Archive the azure-dev-spaces-plugin repository](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3710)
  * [Unable to run mvn incrementals command](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3711)
      * Might be worth a minor doc update
  * [Add JDK21 support for developers to pre-built and try](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3709)
      * As pointed by Tim (for the jenkinsci/docker) we can use weekly with fixed tag name (allowing tracking with updatecli)
  * [Not able to login to artifactory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3702)
  * [CD releases failing (invalid token on trusted.ci.jenkins.io)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3714)
  * [Kubernetes clusters: define `infraciadmin` SVC account as code](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3679)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/77?closed=1):

  * [Account creation mail was not sent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3716)
  * [username issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3718)
  * [The upload to the Maven repository fails with "401 Unauthorized"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3715)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/77):

  * [Assess Artifactory bandwidth reduction options](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3599)
      * Agreement from Jfrog that if can stop mirroring Maven Central, then their expectations will be meet
      * Next meeting friday with JFrog
      * Need to prepare around the Maven issues
  * [[`publick8s`] Ensure high availability of replicated services](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3719)
      * Each of the HA services runs 2 or more pods BUT in some cases these pods are scheduled on the same VM
      * ARM64 as higher probability of this, because only 1 node today
      * We can run more nodes: not a problem. But need to specify the anti-affinity rule to pods definitions
      * @smerle Less priority than ARM64 Docker build, but more important than Intel -> ARM workload migration
  * [[HTTP/401 on repo.jenkins-ci.org] Fix LDAP user configurations in Artifactory to avoid unexpected HTTP/401 when logging in](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3700)
      * Meeting with the support went well: new users now have proper configuration
      * need to batch-fix existing users once
  * [plugin-site build commonly fails on infra.ci when accessing https://plugins.jenkins.io resulting in a 502](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3697)
      * We did not dive more on the topic except the errors peaking every 3 hours
      * @lemeurherve proposed a retry on the pipeline on short term
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * azure.updates.jenkins.io is live in publick8s (mirrorbits + apache + empty data storage)
      * this mirrorbits instances fails to scan the mirrors we are adding: rsync or ftp is needed on mirrors today (mirrorbits constraint)
      * As our R2 Cloudflare mirror is only available with S3 or HTTP protocols, we need to setup a rsync server
      * We used to have a "demo mirror" with its rsync server: re-commissioning it somehow to have rsync
      * Challenge: is the rsync reference mandatory to serves the mirror data?
          * Mounting R2 S3 with any s3\*fuse is tricky or dangerous
          * Or maybe we can use rsync on reference data (as we control mirror updates)
      * Once solved: let's update and sync our mirrors + set up htaccess
      * RFE for mirrorbits to support S3 for scanning mirrors
  * [plugin-aws-global-configuration permission](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3712)
  * [Migrate cert.ci.jenkins.io from `prod-public` to the `private` network](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3688)
      * TF module OK
      * Gotta spawn a new instance for cert.ci
  * [Remove IP restriction on bounce or migrate to VPN](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3624)
      * Blocked by below issue (cerT.ci)
  * [[pkg.jenkins.io] migrate the pkg.origin.jenkins.io service from AWS VM to Azure `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3705)
      * Back to backlog (time + UC blocking)
  * [VMs: improve command prompts to avoid confusion between services](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3681)
      * Nothing done (holidays + ARM64) but @smerle still working on it
  * [ATH builds commonly become unresponsive](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3673)
      * @smerle ideas to build ATH on spot on 1st try, and fall back on ondemand if spot error
      * @dduportal takes over but will pair with @smerle 
  * [LF status page redirect may be cached for too long](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3660)
      * No request sent to LF yet. Not critical item.
  * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
      * All "easy" workloads already migrated
      * WiP on the pipeline library to allow building container arm64 and x86
      * Docker Bake for Linux to allow arm64
      * Status: working on naming convention (e.g. almost there!)
  * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
      * Nothing done. @dduportal need to set up the MySQL instance
