## Attendees ðŸ‘¥

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.510 was successful except the packaging step (see below): https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$qS7sQLqqPYVHOIX9KOOzR2D0K6FF7-FfZcyDW20plyU?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
        * Packaging did fail due to an Artifactory error: the Jenkins WAR's [maven metadata XML file](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/main/jenkins-war/maven-metadata.xml) wasn't properly updated (only the markup "release" was set to 2.510 while the "latest" markup was kept at 2.509). Since packaging relies on this file to detect the latest available version of Jenkins, it required a manual fix (thanks Daniel!). 
            * Most probably an Artifactor-side issue: let's check today's release 2.511 behavior
    * This week: 2.511, started on time - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$g0s2qo40awdXFA6q08a0gjB3MeRLGOO9J7dAR66jFyE?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
2. Announcements:
    * We had a security advisory last week (plugins only): https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories/c/nddPC2_FXrA
    * We will migrate controllers and agents to use JDK21 instead of JDK17 (runtime only!) this Thursday 22 (morning EU)

            * Goal: to deprecate this image in favor of packer-image "all in one", we need arm64 compliance.
            * We are now fully compliant (including typo and typo-checkstyle CLIs) linux/arm64
            * However we do NOT build on arm64 (too slow due to Qemu used for Docker multi architectures, while we use native arm64 for packer-images)
        * [Certbot: keep it up to date (along with its plugins)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4654)
            * Goal: update our outaded version of certbot CLI and its plugin, and keep them up to date

        * [[stats.jenkins.io/infra-statistics] Move "data for the usage stats site" generation (from anonymized data) out from Andrew machine](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4666)

            * Goal: improve adoptium JDK version detection and remove "homemade" shell code.

        * WiP on preparing, almost there. Challenge is to ensure that `JAVA_HOME` still points at Java 17 while installing a JDK21.
            * If, in hieradata (Puppet) we have docker images with only checksum, prepend the tag such as `jenkins/inbound-agent:jdk17@sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxx`
        * Announcement to be done for Thursday 22
