## Attendees

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)

* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* @smerle33 (StÃ©phane Merle)
* @poddingue (Bruno Verachten)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly: 2.359 is published in artifactory + artifactory. Checklist not (yet) complete but no issues detected
  * Further adoption on the JDK/JS/dependencies that *might* introduces instabilities. Be warned for infra.ci.jenkins.io
  * Next weekly will have a Jetty 9 -> 10 upgrade. Major update on a key component.
2. Start using JDK17 on our weekly instances (infra.ci and weekly.ci)
  * No known issues
  * Challenge for agents: we need to update Docker images to have both JDK11 and JDK17 (VM already have)

## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/24?closed=1):
  * [Update analysis-model and warnings-ng on ci.j](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3051)
      * ci.jenkins.io is not a "infra as code with plugins.txt" so we want such requests in the helpdesk while it's done manually
  * [Remove my account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3046)
  * [Remote access API on every non-ci.j.io instance](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3045)
      * Discovered while working on removal of the embeddable build status plugin
      * No need to block API on privtae instances: request from security team to allow them doing more automation
  * [Infra meeting notes as helpdesk releases](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3040)
      * Thanks Herve! We now have a GitHub action to generate the meeting notes
  * [Docker-compose in JenkinsCI.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3039)
      * A plugin maintainer needed to use [testcontainer](https://www.testcontainers.org/) which requires Docker. It was using VM agents (label `linux` by default) but it was choosing randomly ARM or Intel agent which caused obvious issues (Intel binary on ARM64...)
      * Hotfix: `linux` label means "Linux Ubuntu 20.04 AMD64" for now. Labels should be rationalized: but we need to update both pipeline-library, ci.j config AND ci.j documentation.
  * [Add kmartens27 to jenkins.io triage team](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3038)
  * [Weekly release: 2.358 packaging step fails due to AKS CSI Persistent Volume issue (after Kubernetes 1.22 upgrade)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3037)
      * Fixed with the help of Herve and Stephane. Same issue as for LDAP/get.jenkins.io during the kubernetes 1.22 upgrade.
      * We check ALL the other azurefile persistent volumes: no more left to fix
  * [Remove groovy tool configuration from cert.ci JCasC](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3036)
      * Remove tool config, then the plugin.
  * [Grant permission to update-center](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3035)
      * Not done: Tim guided the requesterr to the corect documentation
  * [502 proxy error when accessing PR view for jenkinsci/jenkins](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3029)
      * Tricky issue. Thanks Daniel and Alex for diagnosing
      * Fixed in the culprit plugin by Uli, many thanks!
      * Applied to ci.jenkins once available: immediate fix!
  * [[ci.jenkins.io] Provides both `powershell` and `pwsh` on all agent templates](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2974)
      * VM agent templates: check
      * Windows Docker image: won't do (no blocker)
      * Real value of this issue: we were able to update the public doc. for Jenkins pipeline
  * [DockerHub rate limiting](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2961)
      * We've been granted a team plan on `jenkins4eval` and `jenkinsciinfra`: no more rate limit seen on ci.j after enabling authentication again
  * [[INFRA-1633] Stop building PR merges](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/1355)
      * Old issue. Some "heavy" jobs should not rebuilds PRs when the destination branch is updated, to avoid wasting precious time.
      * Tim set up the aformentioned job. Thanks!
      * We have to write down an issue to manage ci.jenkins.io jobs as code.
  * [ci.jenkins.io agents are very flaky](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3031)
      * Initial problem: Issues on container agents for BOM builds (a lot of executors requested but unable to scale up efficiently leading to a build queue slowly emptying)
      * Correlated to a lot of ATH builds at the same time, spawning a lot of EC2 AWS instances of type "highmem" which are the same size as EKS worker nodes
      * Root cause: We hit our limit for EC2 spot instances of this size in this region (`us-east-2`) leading to a lot of spot reclaims, shutting down agents abruptly during builds
      * Solved by switching from spot to on-demand instances (both AWS and Azure to be safe for ATH). The overcost is low and will be compensated by less builds

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/24):
  * [Downloads /latest directory out of date](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3034)
      * Issue on the azurefile bucket storing the "reference" files for the mirror system (get.jenkins.io): it does not support symlink in the current way that we use it (blobxfer with an old version)
      * fixed manually for LTS (initial request of this issue)
      * Need more work with feedbacks from Olivier V., Tim and Daniel  if they recall how/why
  * [Consider removing embeddable-build-status plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3013)
      * Still to be removed from ci.jenkins.io
      * Batch PR ready to go (prepared and tested by Herve, after a lot of nice tips from Tim, Joseph and Alex)
  * [enable Development integration in Jira](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2985)
      * Nothing done, still to do
  * [[JENKINS-49707] Evaluate `retry` conditions to improve the stability of the builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2984)
      * Almost closable: kubernetes plugin to be released and deployed (Jesse needs 1 or 2 last minors changes in the code)
      * We are happy with the outcome, really valuable
  * [Replace s390x Ubuntu 18.04 agent with s390x Ubuntu 20.04 agent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2983)
      * Mark did not had time yet: nothing done, still to do
      * Request to share SSH access, to test if the machine can run a puppet agent v6 (or v7)
  * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.22](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2930)
      * Almost closable: Last steps: merge documentation PR + create issue for Kuberneets 1.23
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Huge work by Stephane: Oracle infra is set up with Terraform and the machine has a puppet agent connected to our puppetmaster
      * Next steps: create Puppet role for this machine, make it work and start copying JSON files on it (additionnaly to the actual machine)

* New issues:
  * [Broken taglib docs on reports.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3049) => Assigned to Mark, no action required from infra team because it is a javadoc (e.g. dev. scope) thing
  * [Hosted javadocs for LTS versions of Jenkins] => No action from the infra team expected: it is a dev. question and should be raised to the contributors usual channels

* [New/Important](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10):
  * [[terraform:AWS] manage EKS modules as code](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3022)

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/[ID+1])

  * [Self-hosted shield.io instance](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3044) => related to removal of embedabble-build plugin. Herve works on it to evaluate if we can host a shields.io service on the VM for ci.jenkins.io to avoid "breaking" the badge feature.
  * Create issues to track:
      * JDK17 for infra.ci + Agent with both JDK11 and JDK17
      * ci.jenkins.io "as code": Docker image with a plugins.txt
      * ci.jenkins.io jobs "as code" (Job-DSL)
      * Datadog update for monitors (to avoid false positives)
