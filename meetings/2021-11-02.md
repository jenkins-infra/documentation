    * Unrelated to Let's Encrypt change

    * Two contributors now involved with the imagej
    * Could we have a system to "check" these outdated images?
        * Need a security scanner
        * Could use falco rules to check behaviors

    * Working well with Linux and Windows to use spot
    * Next step to use with our AKS cluster
    * When an agent is evicted, that build will fail
    * Might consider automatic retry due to agent eviction
    * Intentionally bid a little higher than current price
        * Reduce risk of eviction until next summer
	* At this stage is we don't have anything to measure the performance
	    * we should work on opentelemetry
