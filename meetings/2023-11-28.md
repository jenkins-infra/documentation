## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/91?closed=1):
    * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
        * Finished the scope of this issue
            * We did weekly.ci.jenkins.io \o\ /o/
            * mirrorbits: no `arm64` binary, stay on x86
            * matomo, MySQL issues with arm64 node pool, stay on x86
        * Main challenge: persistent volume. Let's migrate them to ZRS while moving to `arm64` (over cost is close to nothing)
        * Next steps:
            * Open a new issue next milestone with the remaining services on `publick8s`:
                * LDAP
                * Keycloak
                * others?
            * Decrease x86 node size (see https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3827)
            * infra.ci on arm: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823
            * ci.jenkins.io on arm: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3824
  * [Disable new Jira issues for lockable-resources-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3834)
  * [Need Github repository permissions for Developers](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3831)
  * [Plugin site builds failing on infra.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3816)
  

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/91):
  * [ftp.belnet.be mirror is preventing plugin downloads](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3830)
      * Without a response from requester, we'll enable the mirror again
  * [Moving to alumni in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3829)
      * Done, waiting for confirmation from Oleg
  * [[get.jenkins.io] migrate from `mirrorbits` to `mirrorbits-parent` chart](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3828)
      * No work done
      * Issue to open with cost related to this service (storage is too much due to Azure file storage request costs)
  * [[publick8s] Tune node pool size](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3827)
      * 4 tasks, 1 done, 1 to be reported and 2 todo for the next milestone
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on arm64 (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * Issue body to update with a full plan
      * Let's start!
  * [Grant markewaite access to the infrastructure VPN](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3819)
      * No work done
      * help required by Mark :+1: 
  * [[Sponsorships] Setup the secondary Azure subscription to consume the sponsor credits](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3818)
      * Success with ephemeral VM agents for ci.jenkins.io
      * Looks like credits billing see the new resources
      * Validates our model (vnet peered between subscriptions)
      * Only limit: no Spot instances for now (quota limitation)
      * Next steps:
          * ACI for ci.jenkins.io
          * trusted, cert and infra.ci (VM agents)
      * Q: should we write a blog post about this?
          * A: yes good idea! We only have to wait for the first credits to be used for billing.
  * [[Sponsorships] Renew DigitalOcean sponsorship for 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3817)

      * Deployment almost there from source code
      * Congrats everyone involved in this!

      * Low availability for next milestone, let's delay of 1 week
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)

      * JEP => @lemeurherve this milestone
      * Performance testing => @smerle the milestone after
      * Network security rules? Nice opportunity to test it (and then apply on get.jenkins.io)
