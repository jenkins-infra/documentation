## Cloud Budgets

* Azure CDF - Remaining: $24.000k on 1st January 2026 - monthly threshold set at $6.0k (good until May at the current rate)
    * October: $5.5k (invoice)
    * November: $5.7k (invoice)
    * December: $5.4k (invoice, previously forecasted at $6k)
    * January: $3.9k (forecast at $5.8k, previously at $5.4k)

* DigitalOcean - Remaining $10,411.25 until January 02, 2027 (20 months left at current rate)
    * October: $788.81 (invoice)
    * November: $831.38 (invoice)
    * December: $454.60 (invoice, previously forecasted at $585)
    * January: $282.71 (forecast at ~$345)

* AWS:
    * CloudBees account: does not host anything anymore, account deletion requested in Cloudbees (thanks for the sponsoring!)

    * Sponsored account - $54,613.14 left (31 December 2025) until 31 May 2027=> :warning: 5 months remaining at this rate
        * October: $6.9k
        * November: $5.9k
        * December: $10.7 (previously forecasted at $9.5k way higher than usual)
            * Huge increase due to EC2 plugin bug
        * January: $11.2k (forecast at $15.7k, previously at $11.5k)
            * Still really high, ci.jenkins.io is once again at risk if we don't decrease the consumption or if we don't move it somewhere else before end of April 2026
            * Need an issue ASAP for the EC2 agents GC (Damien)
            * Mark opened an issue on the EC2 plugin: https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/issues/1990
            * Also: we have to request sponsoring renewal

* Jfrog Artifactory Usage
    * Storage: 1.53 Tb - (was 1.53TB last time)
    * Bandwidth:
        * October: 16.67 Tb
        * November: 15.9 Tb
        * December: 30.34Tb
            * A single IP address consumed 12Tb in December
            * JFrog didn't block this address until this month (unless this consumer changed its IP?)
        * January: 11.25 TB Tb (forecast: 16.5 Tb)
            * Sounds like the abuser stopped abusing

            * Support finally told us we should stay free (despite their billing notifications) and not need a credit card
            * However, we saw that both status.jenkins.io and another of our websites are consuming a lot of bandwidth and web requests
