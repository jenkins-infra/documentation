      * Daniel shared a short-term technique to allow testing Jenkinsfile changing in the issue
      * Josep is a contributor whose scope of action is broad. Let's ask him to ask for more permissions for ci.jenkins.io on the mailing list (it's not strictly necessary but sounds practical and useful)
  * [Alert fatigue: Datadog + Pagerduty are too verbose](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3068)
      * Herve and Stephane disabled the "false-positive" monitor.

  * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Start using JDK17](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3072)
