## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly 2.337 release
    * Release is available, Docker images not yet all visible
    * Release checklist still to be run

## Notes :book:

* Issues on ci.jenkins.io:
    * Major: Maven container agents: <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2802>
        * upgraded packages and plugins and restarted yesterday
        * this morning it appeared that no containers had been spawned (race condition)
        * Screenshot of stack trace to be added to the helpdesk ticket
            * Missing classes, classes provided by plugins
            * As though plugins were not loaded during startup
        * Build queue processed quickly
        * May need to test reboot the container, then test reboot the virtual machine
    * Minor: Puppet run failed https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2800
        * Puppet run was failing
        * Agent was asking puppet master to perform a backup / snapshot
            * Space limit on the puppet master
            * Snapshot backup failed because the destination had incorrect permissions
            * Directories with incorrect permissions were 4 years old (unclear why this failed now)
            * Entered a portion of the tree that had incorrect permissions
            * See the helpdesk issue
* Issue on VPN: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2798
    * Expiring certificate: thanks to @olblak we have been able to add documentation on how to easily regenerate the certificate
    * Server side certificate expired Feb 26, 2022
        * Needed more documentation on how to generate the server-side certificate
        * Generated certificates with @smerle but were missing some specific attributes
        * Pointed to the location, is now documented
    * @lemeurherve and @smerle both have access
* Issues on trusted.ci.jenkins: 
    * Major: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2801 causing RPU + update-center delays (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2799)
    * Delay running update center and repository permissions updater
        * Two days of delayed jobs, half were the GitHub reports
        * User reported issue (Alex Brandes)
    * Monday was the day to expire credentials (end of month)
    * Credential rotated on trusted.ci, rebooted the virtual machine, and user issue resolved

* Post incidents: calendar updated for credentials expiration routines (Azure SP secrets + VPN certificates)
    * No more expired credentials in Azure SPs as for today
    * infra.ci's Azure packer credential to be rotated - 2 weeks left
    * All of the `codevalet-*`, `rtyler*` and `olblak*` app had been removed
    * All apps with credentials expired since 2 years+ removed
        * Removed expired credentials for service principal applications
    * Still a few that need more detailed review
        * Should have enough permissions for @smerle and @lemeurherve able to rotate
        * Credential to be rotated expires in next two weeks

* Azure AD permissions
    * Stephane + Herve have the same rights as Damien
    * We could not assign "privileged roles" to groups (neither create "custom groups") with our current Azure plan (require a premium account)
        * Not needed, so let's manage "manually" (less than 15 people) + it seems that Terrraform might be able to manage this part
    * Enforced MFA to everyone on the Azure Portal / API
        * Had to enforce per-user for now

* Digital Ocean :party:
    * Added to ci.jenkins.io since 12 days
        * Added and they are operating as expected
    * TODO:
      * Measure costs consumed (no visible access to the billing page)
      * Updating ci.jenkins.io documentation for agents
      * DigitalOcean sponsorship
          * Add DigitalOcean on the [sponsor section of home page](https://www.jenkins.io/)
          * We have a blog post to start
          * Our cluster will be updated in 6 days with their Kubernetes updates / patches
              * Similar policy to Azure, changes are applied on their version, visible to us

* Request from security team to add Windows agent on cert-ci
    * Done, thanks Stephane! VPN routes are :white_check_mark: 
    * Weird issue: upgrading LTS from 2.319.1 to 2.319.3 deleted the cloud config!
        * No explanation for the removal
        * Manually managed configuration was deleted during the upgrade
        * Should regularly store copies of the configuration
        * Recreated templates
    * Tried new label pattern:
        * Agents label only with "kernel"-related dimensions (OS, CPU, Docker, Size). For cert.ci: `azure vm linux` / `azure vm windows` for instance
        * Using tools, with the method shown by Mark, with "fallbacks" (e.g. using shell script to define local path, otherwise fallback to default installer), for "easy to get" tools: Git, JDK, Maven, etc.
            * Manage them with the global tools system inside Jenkins
            * Use locally installed JDK from the agent
        * Puppet templating allows to provide "improved" naming: `jdk8` and `jdk-8` for tools, to handle user typos for instance
            * Same definition for the two labels
            * Could use the implied labels plugin rather than duplicating the definition
                * Implied labels does not have configuration as code (keep an XML file) - https://plugins.jenkins.io/implied-labels/
            * Automate of labels for agent - https://plugins.jenkins.io/platformlabeler
        * see Jessie's comment at the end: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/302#pullrequestreview-880542168 
            * `Maybe we should retire maven and make it maven-8?`
            * Container OK, but not VM: todo
            * pipeline-library change then

* infra-report to be migrated out from trusted.ci into infra.ci
    * helpdesk initial issue: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2788
    * Migrate to infra.ci (from trusted)
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2789
        * Bump & bruises around Docker image to use (Alpine Linux 3.14+, used by JNLP k8s agents, require a recent Container Engine, and our current setup with `img` blocks it) => WiP on building with fully-fledged Docker Engine on ephemeral VM agents (thanks to Stephane's work earlier this year). Allows Windows Container builds + ARM64 builds + docker buildx-bake full support.
    * Switch from github bot user to Github App
        * Github App created:
        * Need to tune required permissions
        * Might need to use another langage than Ruby (NodeJS?) as the GraphQL library doesn't seem to return a full error log

* iptables on ci.jenkins.io after spam: closed (iptables rules cleared by reboot + no more spam)

* IRC notifs: the new IRC channel is :white_check_mark: 
    * We had to run the puppet agent on the puppet master itself + reboot to apply the changes

## Action Points :muscle:

* [x] Publish this meeting note on [jenkins-infra/documentation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation) - @dduportal 
* [ ] Publish this meeting record on Youtube - @MarkEWaite 
* [ ] Publish a topic in community.jenkin.io with the tag `meeting`
