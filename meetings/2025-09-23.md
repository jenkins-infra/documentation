## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/178?closed=1):
    * Support:
      * [[ci.jenkins.io] Brownout disabling readonly access.](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4806)
          * Outage on ci.jio => no more DDoS
          * Next brownout requires a bit of groovy/puppet setup on ci.jio to add the correct permissions to authenticated users (otherwise only admin have permissions)
      * [PR-merge strategy used in Libraries](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4803)
    * Keep platform up to date:
      * [Update ci.jenkins.io, trusted.ci, cert.ci and release.ci to latest LTS version 2.516.3](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4805)

* [Work in Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/178):
    * Keep platform sane and maintainable:
        * [[Azure] Migrate (e.g. re-create) AKS clusters `publick8s` and `privatek8s` with modern settings (private API, Azure Linux, NAT outbound)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4617)
            * New cluster is created, and runs ~75%  of applications
            * Remaining application to validate before migrating: LDAP "stack" , www.origin.jenkins.io (need a chart change), weekly.ci.jenkins.io
            * Planning full migration Wednesday, or Thursday (if last minute problems)
            * Outage on updates.jenkins.io and get.jenkins.io yesterday: @dduportal needs to write issue + post mortem.
                * Need to report issue on mirrorbits repo with logs
            * Kubernetes 1.32 will be next
        * [[INFRA-1972] Migrate usage.jenkins.io VM from AWS CloudBees to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/1626)
            * VM recreated (due a minor terraform mistake we prefer fixing properly before migration)
                * VPN and firewall already updated. Might need minor updatecli manifest later
            * Data transfer from AWS to DO started (~147 Go). A bit more needed once the VM is back in shape
            * Next step: ensure Puppet provisioning works completely as expected (after VM recreation)
        * [[stats.jenkins.io/infra-statistics] Move "data for the usage stats site" generation (from anonymized data) out from Andrew machine](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4666) 
            * On hold: require usage.jenkins.io to be migrated in DigitalOcean
        * [[cert.ci/trusted.ci/private.vpn] Default outbound access for VMs in Azure will be retired](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4616)
            * On hold: need publick8s to be migrated first
        * [Reduce artifactory bandwidth used by ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4747)
            * jenkinsci/docker PR from Herve merged to use mirrors (get.jenkins.io) for WAR retrieval instead of Artifactory for ci.jenkins.io CI builds
                * We'll confirm non regression for the publication today for the weekly release => trusted.ci is expected to retrieve the WAR file from Artifactory instead (so we can build Docker images even if packaging fails)
        * [[pkg.jenkins.io] migrate the pkg.origin.jenkins.io service from AWS VM to Azure `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3705)
            * On hold: due to publick8s migration AND the Artifactory reduction
        * [[Azure] Merge webservices data storage accounts into a single one with NFS v4.1](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4767)
            * Next candidate is www.jenkins.io
            * Part of the new publick8s cluster
        * [[ci.jenkins.io] Monitor and Garbage collect data volume of the DockerHub registry mirror and EC pull through cache](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4547)
            * On hold: (project "cron jobs" in infra.ci)
        * [Implement a retry mechanism with non-spot instance in `jenkinsci/jenkins` pipeline](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4790)
            * WiP by Hervé on this one. More tests to run.
            * On hold until other issues are fixed (see issue content)
            * Would be helpful/simpler to have Hervé with admin rights on ci.jenkins.io (see issue below)
        * [Monitor builds on our private instances (trusted.ci.jenkins.io / infra.ci.jenkins.io / release.ci.jenkins.io)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2843)
            * On hold (Jay will resume after Kubernetes training and Jenkins laptop setup)
        * [Reduce artifactory bandwidth used by infra.ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4745)
            * To be closed (no more data)
        * [Tombstone Puppet (and replace it by something else)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4714)
            * Back to triage (no hands on deck here)

        * [Add support for Windows 2025 agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4791)
            * On hold (after the draft PR which seems to be good to roll)
            * Let's merge the scripted pipeline PR! (need one last cleanup from Stephane, then we can review, merge and trigger a release)
            * Windows 2025 delayed (to avoid overcost)
        * [Update Jira LTS from 9.12.x to 10.3.x](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4644)
            * On hold until publick8s is migrated
    * ci.jenkins.io production issues:
        * [[ci.jenkins.io] Pipelines are stuck in RPU (Agents slow to allocate / build timeouts due to agent reclaimed)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4768)
        * [ci.jenkins.io pages are slow to respond](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4780)
            * Initial try at a brownout failed (enabling login is OK, but missing permissions in groovy.d)
        * [ci.jenkins.io agents are allocated but do not connect](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4807)
            * Capacity issue is the root cause
            * But we also have EKS Terraform failures: need to investigate
