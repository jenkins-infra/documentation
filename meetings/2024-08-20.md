        * It was a mistaken hostname

            * Way better these Gbits/s out from our system than from Artifactory ;) (reduced load)
    * [[get.jenkins.io, azure.updates.jenkins.io] MaxMind GeoIP Rate Limit hit when redeploying/upgrading `mirrorbits` chart](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4240)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/123?closed=1):
    * [Missing dynamic update center for 2.452.4](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4245)
    * [NA](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4239)

* Work in Progress (Milestone [123](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/123)):
    * [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * JDK17 and JDK21 templates created and deployed for Linux Inbound, Linux SSH and Windows inbound (ci.jio, trusted.ci.jio, cert.ci.jio)

            * PR opened, fixed, ready to deploy
        * WiP Windows SSH templates => @dduportal
            * Adding environment variable works 
            * But not changing Path (due to Windows OpenSSH behavior)
                * User/Machine env. level + restart SSH service
                * Fallback: remove default JDK from Windows VM templates
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Azure VM agent init script not in sync with Puppet code](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4244)
        * Found while working on [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * Datadog often fails to start during agent init phase
        * PR opened, ready to deploy as well
    * [Suspend distribution of the windows-slaves-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4221)
        * This plugin uses an outdated technique to launch agents. It should not work anymore *except* if you purchased extended MS support for Windows 2012...
        * Concern: will we break users setup if any has this (exotic) setup?
        * Discussion still in progress (ref. PR on update-center2)
    * [plugin stats for bouncycastle-api are missing data.](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4213)
        * Need coding "help" to solve it => not really a direct action can be done by the infra team
        * Removing from milestone, and even move it to the repository
    * On hold (no work done or waiting from someone outside):
        * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Builds stucks due to GH API rate limit](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4165)
        * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)

    * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
        * We are able to run mirrorbits on arm64 \o/
            * 2 method but we have to choose:
                * We build the binary ourselves
                * Debian package
            * Let's move all mirorbits to arm64!
        * Last leftover: LDAP and we can get rid of x86 nodes

     * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
         * Fixed the frequent 503 errors
             * Serve stale data (5 min old) instead of 503, thanks to fallback
         * Improved monitoring: collecting all kind of logs
         * Improved security (RO filesystem, no capabilities, etc.)
         * No errors using it with ALL of our controllers
             * Neither from MarkWaite's network
         * Next step:
             * Use mirrorbits gRPC client instead of kubectl exec on trusted.ci
             * Add datadog monitoring on the expected URL to validate redirections and content
             * Generate missing index listing

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/124)

        * Let's get started with kubectl
        * infra.ci-agents cluster to migrate end of week
    * [To host stats.jenkins.io GSoC 2024 project in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4132)
        * Need helm-chart update to implement the fix => @lemeurherve takes care of it
        * Almost end of GScoC: this is a nice last item!
    * [Cannot release a new plugin with CD even if tokens are created and automatic PR on RPU merged](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4248)
    * [RPU GSoC project with terraform integration on infra's backend](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4246)
