            * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4713
        * Azure SP used to deploy websites to production from infra.ci (into file shares):

                * We had an (expected) hiccup: arm64 Linux spot node pools cannot scale to zero. We always 1 VM up and running as such => spot instance so low cost
