## Notes :book:

* Ashutosh Saxena for GSoc
    * Until now, used GitHub Actions + Docker Hub Registry for Docker image
    * ghcr.io would be a good place to start, because any maintainer could participate without special credentials => let's move to ghcr
    * jenkins (`jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17`) and jenkinsciinfra (`jenkinsciinfra/ldap:latest`)
        * Mapped 1:1 to GitHub organization: jenkinsci, and jenkins-infra 
        * www.jenkins.io
            * jenkins-infra/jenkins.io
            * `jenkinsciinfra/jenkins.io`
    * => we want an exhaustive list of the images Ashutosh will produce `jenkins/tutorial-controller-` for DockerHub images
    * Source code: monorepo or multiple repositories?
        * Today, for Gscoc scope, we have 1 repo for all images
    * Lifecycle of releases
        * What is triggering a new image version?
            * A change to the code is merged
            * A new dependency is available
        * Then what would be the trigger to update jenkins.io tutorial?
            * Automatic dependency update detected (dependabot or updatecli)
    * CI?
        * ci.jenkins.io => Jenkinsfile, + action from jenkins-infra team to track the job for build
    * CD?
        * infra.ci.jenkins.io over trusted.ci?
            * infra.ci proposal, easier to operate and less security concerncs about the image content
    * jenkins-infra/helpdesk issue to open to track these tasks

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/80?closed=1):
  * [Expiration of the Digital Oceans PATs [September 2023](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3749)
  * [(September 2023) Update VPN CRL](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3747)
      * Renewed for 6 months as usual
      * Calendar added
      * St√©phane updated the doc
      * GPG keys renewed for St√©phane and Herv√©, also removed Olivier Vernin's (olblak) outdated keys
  * [IntelliJ plugin builds fail on Windows because Gradle cannot cleanup](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3744)
  * [JDK21: change from nightly builds to weekly `ea` builds in the infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3736)
      * Upgrade done on both packer-image AND kubernetes-management AND Puppet
      * Also, version tracked with `updatecli`: we expect automatic PR to keep JDK21 up to date for now 
      * Release of the official LTS JDK21 soon, might need to remove the `-ea_beta` suffix everywhere

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/80):
  * [Assess Artifactory bandwidth reduction options](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3599)
      * No more Apache Maven Central mirrored!
      * Logs receieved from JFrog so we can track impact on bandwidth
      * We expected positive impact after repopulating the cache
      * maven-hpi-plugin ITs are broken and Damien needs help to solve it
  * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
      * Fixed pipeline library: ATH image is build again with success and we keep arm64
      * List added in the issue, not absolutely exhaustive but a good start
      * ‚ö†Ô∏è updatecli must be aware of the arm64 images (and check both Intel and ARM)
      * We have to switch images with an sha (that we build) to the semver automatic deployment (instead of latest or manual or weekly updates)
      * Another improvement: speed up the Docker image library to create/push tags at the same time for both GH and Docker (instead of running additional build)
          * Issue to create by @smerle , the "why" is to decrease build costs from infra.ci
  * [[`publick8s`] Ensure high availability of replicated services](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3719)
      * PR for wiki to start with anti-affinity (in arm64 because more probable to happen as less nodes than x86_64)
      * Next step: we need a list of task to apply this
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Digital Ocean primary mirror is being built
          * Worst case billing: 700$ per month (10x less than current AWS!)
      * Cloudlfare answered and is evaluating our sponsorship (for US and Asia mirrors)
      * Oracle for 1 year on US as secondary fallback
      * Deploy update center JSON index on all the mirrors 
  * [A few SSL certificates expire in 25 days or less](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3748)
      * Problem is our AKS cert-manager ingress: details in issue, gotta work on it next milestone
  * [Unexpected long delay uploading BOM artifact s3 bucket](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3745)
      * New ci.jenkins.io pipeline behavior flag setup
  * [`nexus-jenkins-plugin` bundles proprietary dependency](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3742)
      * No action: removing from milestone
  * [Remove account request field from Jira login page](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3735)
  
  * [LF status page redirect may be cached for too long](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3660)
  
  * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
      * New subnet is created for mysql
      * Draft for the terraform manager MySQL instance: need to discuss and validate some specs
      * Started to clean up Docker image, but no more work (yet)
          * arm64 soon? ;)
  
  * [[INFRA-3154] Certain emails from Jenkins mailing lists are failing SPF](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2696)
      * not worked but @smerle might have some time to spend on
  
  * jenkins-infra/packer-images: Cleaning up playwright artifacts (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/pull/801)
      * @smerle might check and add additional context
      * Recommendation is to only cleanup artefacts after the sanity check
  * jenkins/packaging: Redirecting pkg.jenkins.io to install doc page (https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/pull/431)
      * Non-infra topic

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/81)
