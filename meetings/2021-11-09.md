## Attendees

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @hlemeur (HervÃ© Le Meur)
* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* Aditya Srivastava

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins 2.320 release is in progress (war done, Docker images done, checklist needed)
2. Helm chart refactoring is in progress
    * Simplifying file structure for clusters
    * Easier to understand and manage
    * Split chart repository for ease
4. Jenkins election voter registration is closed with 81 registered voters


## Notes :book:

* LTS 2.303.3 + Weekly 2.319 released successfully
  * Issue with the VPN machine (see below) fixed just in time
  * enabled again release.ci.jenkins.io (to be added to the procedure)
  * TBD: update the procedure for sec. team to add such PR or issue

* Certificate renewal failure for archives.jenkins.io
  * Fixed by @MarkEWaite :heart:
  * Next expiry is in february: Calendar event added in january to ensure that it's ok
  * WDYT about Traefik for these kind of services (e.g. VM with single Docker Engine, 1-2 domains max)
      * Intentionally used a separate machine to spread bandwidth costs
      * May need similar technique for pkg.jenkins.io

* VPN
  * Network issue on the VPN VM
    * When the VM is rebooted (kernel upgrade), `eth1` and `eth2` are inverted randomly
    * Fixed by @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ :heart: in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/1968
      * Refinements todo: (newbie friendly) in https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3124
    * Reboot are faster (and we feel safe again to reboot the VM)
  * CRL expired on VPN:
    * Fixed by @dduportal :hearth: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3123
    * Next expiry added on the infra calendar to ensure we don't reproduce the error (thanks @timja)
  * Future of VPN VM:
      * As per https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/blob/81ffe0e0c1827716b9e624eb5c2e228346e91a0e/plans/vnets.tf the 3rd network interface is about the "private network" which we do not use (private services such as ci.j or private.aks are part of a subnet of public, not exposed publically)
      * The VPN VM is a big one (4 vCPUS / 16 GB :scream:) because of the need for 3 network interfaces
      * We do not use private network as for today: proposal to migrate VPN to a smaller one, with only the "public network"
          * Good opportunity to restart working on the terraform process for https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure (import and manage again resources as code instead of manually)

* Infra Costs
  * EC2 Spot instances
    * :heavy_check_mark: on ci.jenkin.io's instances  - https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3101
    * :heavy_check_mark: on EKS workers - https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3104
    * TODO: check prices after the WE of 6-7 of november
    * Worker instances allowed to use any of a series of instance types
        * Maximize spot pool availability
  * Azure VM usage
      * @timja mentioned error messages about storage account on ci.jenkins.io's log. Is it bad config? (former)bug with the azure-vm-plugin?
          * Latest version seems ok
          * Symptom: ci.jenkins.io cloud stats don't show all 3 Azure types (highmem, ubuntu, windows)
      * We should check that we use these machines and increase the limits in Azure (+ decrease on EC2)
          * TODO: write the 2 JIRA issues to ask Azure support to increase our cpu limits
  * Azure Spot: to check (if it works as well as EC2, it's a quick win)
      * TODO: write JIRA issue
  * New providers:
      * Need to "Librarize" the Terraform tasks. [jenkins-infra/aws](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/aws) is the reference, and [jenkins-infra/datadog](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/datadog) should be adapted as example
      * Then we can start [Digital Ocean](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3102) and [Scaleway](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3122)
      * k3s: [recycle the 2 OSUSL machines](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3103) + WDYT about CivoCloud?


* wiki.jenkins.io
  * Service is back, it's replicated (in AKS), virus-free ðŸ˜… and automatically managed through helm chart
  * Thanks @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ :hearts: for the heavy work
  * Proposal from @MarkEWaite to put the service behind fastly (like jenkins.io) WDYT?
      * If yes, TODO: @MarkEWaite write JIRA issue
  * Work done here is a good exercise to restart the work on jenkins.io?
      * Docker image with content inside
      * If yes, TODO: @dduportal write JIRA issue


* AKS helm charts/helmfile
  * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/public-charts created (initial idea to split charts)
      * Should we name it "charts" only? https://github.com/jenkins-infra/public-charts/issues/12
  * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/charts to be renamed to map its intent (e.g. helmfile management)
      * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/charts/issues/1649
  * Thanks @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ for improving/cleaning up this part!

* ratings.jenkins.io
    * Gavin updated it, it works again :heart:
      * includes using the pipeline-library to build/test/release the Docker image + add the job to infra.ci
        * Should we rename the repository "ratings" to "docker-ratings" so we don't need to have a specific regexp for this repo?
        * same for [account-app](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/account-app)?
        * Considering using a PostgreSQL managed database in Azure
            * Might also work with CockroachDB
            * [INFRA-1973](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-1973) Moving into the Kubernetes cluster simplifies management

* Kubernetes 1.20 upgrade
    * Currently running 1.19, planning for update

* JDK updates for 8 and 11?
    * Jenkins Docker image?
        * 8 => 8u302 (not latest because 8u312 not available)
        * 11 => latest 11.0.13 \o/
        * 17 => 17.0 (preview image needs to be updated) - https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/17/debian/bullseye/hotspot/Dockerfile#L1
    * Jenkins agents?
        * @MarkEWaite  submitted PR for those. merged bu not released yet.
    * Infra VMs: :white_check_mark: - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/releases/tag/0.8.0
    * Infra tools: :white_check_mark: - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/1961 and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/1952
    * Infra containers? (wip docker -> packer)
        * 8u302 => to be updated 8u312
        * latest 11.0.13
    * Should we propose PRs to use updatecli for official jenkinsci images?

* Cleanups
    * TODO:
        * Puppet (confluence, JIRA, kubernetes)
        * Azure (storage accounts, pkr* resource groups)
  
* s390x agent was handling jobs aimed to be built on amd64 machines
    * ARM EC2 have the same behavior
    * Related to labels: "java"
        * Use "java-arm64", "java-s390x", "java-ppc64le" on other hardware
    * @dduportal to create JIRA issue and work on it
