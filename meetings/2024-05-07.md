* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/110):
    * [To host versioned jenkins.io docs on docs.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3885)
        * docs.jenkins.io is live :party: 
        * PR have preview on Netlify
        * Production on Nginx in our cluster, cached by Fastly CDN (same architecture as contributors.jenkins.io)
        * Next (and last step): runbook to be written (last mile, easy one)
        * Note: we want, in the near future, to split in multiple jobs to separate CD from preview deployments
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Migrated to a new file storage (premium)
        * Validated functionnaly that redirects are now working as expected (with all traffic to Apache, then redirects to either get.jio, or the mirrors.updates.jio, then another redirect to a mirror (cloudflare))
        * Wip: PR in review/test on update_center2 to generate distinct content for the 2 services
            * Herve is working on testing the PR on trusted.ci without impacting the current job
    * [[ci.jenkins.io] Migrate ci.jenkins.io EKS clusters out from CloudBees AWS account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3954)
        * Specified the network/naming and sizing, validated in pair with Herve

        * WiP: initial cluster creation
    * [[ci.jio/infra.ci.jio] datadog plugin destroyed the build data. Can we stop using it?](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4080)
        * Rollbacked to 6.02 on ci.jio
        * Lets keep datadog on ci.jio and try 7.0.1 => we'll keep observing but need runbook to ensure we have backup if it fails again
        * Removed from infra.ci/weekly.ci as not used
    * [Enable 2FA on jenkinsci npm account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4073)
        * We can use `oathtool` for this (like AWS sponsored or Digital Ocean) => runbook shows everything so ready to go
        * Let's try this milestone, otherwise we'll delay until Herve's back (end of May)
    * [Add `.war.asc` to get.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4055)
        * WiP: PR by Mark with reviews from Basil.
            * Refactor of the current shell tooling. Working on duplicated code between jenkinsci/packaging and jenkins-infra/release.
            * Consider permissions of both repositories for Jenkins Infra
            * Path to removing the `jv` golang tool (almost unmainted) as part of the process
  
  * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Abort and remove (immediately) orphaned builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4072)
