## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/51?closed=1):
  * [Old inbound-agent published as "latest"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3318)
  * [Valid ssl certificate for `trusted.ci.jenkins.io`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3091)
  * [Remove Deprecated plugin "Handlebars" from our instances](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3357)
  * [Artifact caching proxy 504 Gateway time-out errors with the Azure provider](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3221)
  * [Artifact caching failed on DigitalOcean and AWS Kubernetes pods](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3302)
  * [SQL queries to run on Plugin Health Scoring database](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3356)
  * [IRC bot jenkins-admin is offline](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3354)
  * (no issue) uplink service was down (dashboard not available at least). Restarted the pod and.. it just worked!
      * See new issues about updating dependencies below
      * We can't tell if any telemetry was lost during the incident
      * It seems that it uses a Sentry.io account: we need to get access (Olivier? Tyler? Baptiste Mathus? Daniel?)
      * PostgreSQL Azure Database to be migrated into our "flexible" instance
  * [Add "playwright" tool in our agent images](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3345)
      * Deployed last friday with 0.55.0
  * Agent template 0.56.0 provides updates JDKs

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/51):
  * [renew the signer certificate for jenkins](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3323)
      * Digicert access confirmed by @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag . Let's work on it after the `2.375.3` LTS 
      * Another issue opened to document the process in a runbook
      * 29 January says expiration in 60 days so we're not late
  * [Bump the terraform module for AWS EKS (and consequences)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3305)
      * Almost finished, but ACP AWS is now working
  * [(Re) Introduce an artifact caching proxy for ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2752)
      * We intend to enable ACP for the `buildPlugin()` by default this week
      * WiP on providing a pipeline library function to start testing on BOM, ATH, Jenkins Core and other "non plugin" maven builds
          * BOM is enormous so should be interesting to see
      * Will add a dedicated issue + send an email for "plugins" ACP activation
          * One last step before: PR https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/552 to provide per-PR opt-out
          * Another opt-out is to update the `Jenkinsfile` by setting argument `artifactCachingProxyEnabled` to false
      * ACP metrics:
          * Datadog metrics show resource usage of all container instances precisely to understand the usage
          * Azure Portal show the disk metrics (IOPS)
          * ACP access logs show if request are served by caching, or from Jfrog (with response time from JFrog)
          * We overprovisionned the container and replicated them, but we still have more resources leverages: scaling up, scaling horizontally, increasing cache disk size, switching cache disk to a better IOPS quality level (we have plenty)
      * Timing: once label PR is merged, we send the email on jenkinsci-dev letting 24h before switching to "default ACP"
  * [Ensure all GitHub action versions are pinned and tracked](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3355)
  * [AKS: add cluster `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3351)
      * Cluster up and running
      * ACP is running (along with side services)
      * On hold until ACP handles way more things (such as BOM)
  * [AKS: add cluster `privatek8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2844)
      * Same as publick8s: up and running, infra.ci works well now
      * On hold until ACP handles way more things (such as BOM)
  * [[INFRA-2754] Realign repo.jenkins-ci.org mission](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2322)
      * WiP: LDAP HA 
      * WiP: writing but on hold because logs from JFrog shows that mirrored repos are not the major problem

* [New/TODO (next milestone)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/52)
  * [Update `uplink.jenkins.io` project dependencies](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3363)
  * uplink.jenkins.io: migrate PostgreSQL database to flexible
  * uplink.jenkins.io: Sentry replacement or access
  * [Document the code signing certificate renewal process](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3361)
      * Let's work on it after the `2.375.3` LTS 
  * [Ensure removed jenkins.io pages aren't accessible and indexed anymore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3360)
      * Short term: documentation (both jenkins.io and runbook) + clean up this page (to "test" the whole operation 1 time)
      * Long term: automate clean up
  * [Frequent PagerDuty Alerts `Disk space is below 1GB free win-xxx-yyyyyy`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3359)
  * [Ask Linux Foundation to renew our Jira license](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3362)
