      * 3 VMs created with their network, security groups, disks, etc.
      * VM requested Puppet binding to the puppet master, which is good and expected
      * Next steps: puppet agent run, validate, and start data migration
      * Handed over to Damien because holidays
  * [[Azure Billing] Excessive consumption on `eastus-cijenkinsio` resource group](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3551)
      * Wait for 2 weeks for billing
      * If spot kills or slows down build too much, we can switch back, but we should move agent network
      * We should move ci.jenkins VM agents to inbound in the new network 
  * [Feat(Infra.ci): add Azure ARM64 VMs](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3471)

  * [AKS: add cluster `publick8s`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3351)
      * weekly.ci.jenkins.io migrated 
      * Currently: migrating "stateless" services: javadoc, reports etc.
      * Next "tricky" part: PgSQL based servicesMight need
      * Opportunity to import as code the DNS records
          * DNS TTL to 60s before migration, ideally 24h before a DNS record change
      * V1/V2 for bucket storages: issue to be created
  * [DigitalOcean leftover disk to cleanup ?](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3579)
  * [[ci.jenkins.io] Use DigitalOcean VM agents instead of container agents](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3576)
      * Draft of Packer build for Linux x86_64
      * Next step: try the plugin for Jenkins to spawn VM agents
  * [Cleanup and import unmanaged Datadog monitorings in terraform](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3558)
      * We have some *old*, *deprecated* and *manually* monitors to be cleaned up and moved to IaC
      * We were able to get rid of the custom `docker-datadog` image \o/
      * Solution to be found for monitoring trusted.ci's job (update center) as we do not want to use datadog inside the controller itself
  * [Artifact caching proxy is unreliable](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3481)

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/67)
