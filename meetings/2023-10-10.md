  * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
      * G.A. v4 is a problem and due to we can't upgrade, no stats since end of July => prioritized
      * WiP: adding a matomo database with is own user
      * WiP: helm chart, to be tested without ingress (public access) at first
  * [Ensure removed jenkins.io pages aren't accessible and indexed anymore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3360)

      * JDK21 available (at least a first subset of installers)
          * Let's check the platforms (x86, amd64, but s390x? And Windows?)
      * Write infrastructure JDK support timeline
          * What about "next/edge" version such as JDK22?
          * JDK LTS support end of life?
          * Need discussion and writing (mention cost of a lot of tests/agents)
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)

              * AWS S3 on the `jenkins` user as the non-default profile
              * AzCopy uses SAS token, provided as a Jenkins credential
          * jenkins-infra/update_center2 now has a PR for this, but failing: tests in progress in a copy of the job (works locally so almost there)
          * Goal: test the new update_center2 website (with mirrors and Cloudflare)
          * Note: performance! <3min (or not all 3 min)
      * WiP (helm chart)
          * The new helm chart (featuring umbrella PVC and ingress) is deployed but breaks the mirrorbits
              * Hack: Disable httpd as an ingress backend
              * Related to a non obvious path with regex and nginx locations
          * WiP on templatizing the mirorrbits config. No priority on this now.
