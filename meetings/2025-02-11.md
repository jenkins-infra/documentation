## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last weeks:
        * 2.495 released with no issues the 28 January 2025 - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$5Z4BGCjACZvXYm0M6X54CPr1UHKUvcsDcWguKtIBT8k?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org

    * This Week: 2.497 started on time and should be released and deployed later today - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$utW4Nqd_AiQCZB7qWfqWodsYj4A0B9Hq_0W_6PAavwM?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
    * LTS release last week (5 Feb. 2025) 2.492.1
2. Outages:
    * Azure Container Instances: no more outage, back to normal
    * Cloudflare R2 outage the 6 February 2025 (see https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/pgz7g5xlpxzr)
        * No impact for our users: Update Center requests were redirected to archives.jenkins.io or served without problem (except slightly increased latency) by R2 HTTP endpoints
        * Update center metadata were only updated on archives during the incident though
    * LDAP Outage Friday 7 February 2025: described in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4531
        * Root cause: sudden disk issues due to missing Azure permissions. Fixed
        * Impacted LDAP but also weekly.ci, infra.ci and release.ci
3. Migration of ci.jenkins.io to AWS scheduled this Thursday 13 February 2025 at 09:00UTC

            * Change of plan: we discarded the "Install 2 AWS CLI with a pinned old version for Cloudflare"
            * Rationale: Cloudflare support (in their discourse forum in which we posted) gave us a new flag for the AWS CLI to use, making the latest version working perfectly. Crawler is using it with success
            * Scope of the issue is extended: we have to apply the fix to Update Center and then make sure it uses the latest AWS CLI (as we discovered we forgot to keep it updated)

            * Delayed until AWS migration
