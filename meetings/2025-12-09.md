Of course we might run into some unknowns (concurent weekly/LTS, unified RPM on weekly but not on LTS, first security process with staging, first LTS with RPM generated on release.ci agent, etc.): there will be hiccups and room for improvements.
        * Once LTS is release, we'll be able to close this issue (Definition of Done is only `createrepo` run on release.ci. Any issue/improvement on staging will be a subject for issues in jenkinsci/packaging and/or jenkins-infra/release).
