      * Plugins, Core, BOM/PCT are using ACP :party:
      * A lot of useful but hidden work on the pipeline-library (`runWithMaven()`, etc.)
      * backend-extensions-indexer (which has raw mentions repo.jenkins-ci.org)
      * ATH uses `runMaven()`: should be also using ACP (to confirm)

      * Nothing done (yet) on the HA for LDAP/authentication on mirrors on JFrog => on hold for now (ACP is priority)
  * [Add NotMyFault to trusted.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3381)
      * Go for it, given the issues we recently had on the Docker image
      * Long term: migrate to release.ci
  * [Redirect Chinese pages to English pages and shutdown the Chinese site](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3379)
      * Low priority : backlog

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/55)
