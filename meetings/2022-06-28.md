    * New task which involves adding HTTP redirection from old domain (`pkg.jenkins-ci.org`) to the new domain (`pkg.jenkins.io`) with enforced HTTPS to avoid such issues in the future, as a courtesy to people running instances since years with the "legacy" domains.
  * [Claim that updates.jenkins.io certificate is sometimes expiring](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3017)

      * Downside: hitting the hard limit of public IP on Azure VMs
