## Announcement :loudspeaker:

2. No Weekly expected: security release on Core(s) tomorrow (Wed. 09th of February 2022).
    * Security release that will be 2.333 plus security changes
    * No form modernisation first released next Tuesday
    * May be OK to include the transition from System-V init to systemd
3. Security release of plugins the Tuesday 15th of February (e.g. next week), weekly to be delayed for the 16th of February
    * Plugin security advisory coming
    * Proposed to delay weekly release one day (Wednesday)


## Notes :book:

* Security releases
  * 2022-02-09: 
      * Core(s) only (weekly 2.334 and LTS 2.319.3)
      * ‚ö†Ô∏è release.ci.jenkins.io and ci.jenkins.io must NOT be updated until the release is applied
      * ‚úÖ ci.jenkins.io and release.ci (and trusted and infra) had been updated (plugins, kernels, packages)
      * ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatic weekly got triggered again. Daniel caught it and was kind enough to stop it. 
          * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/kubernetes-management/pull/1979 to remove release.ci from kubernetes management to avoid unexpected reload (at least MOST of the unexpected reloads)
      * Release (jenkins-infra/release) pipelines:
          * ‚úÖ Weekly staged released
          * ‚ùå LTS (security) failed (`missing jarsigner`): I forgot to cherry pick from main (weekly) branch. Fixed for sec LTS with https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/pull/220 and with current LTS with https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/pull/221 "just in case"
              * Mark and Stephane pair to cherry pick to stable-2.332
  * 2022-02-15:
      * Plugins only
      * ‚ö†Ô∏è trusted.ci.jenkins.io, release.ci and ci.jenkins.io must NOT be updated this day (as per Daniel's comment `there might be very minor weirdness with the mirrorsync script, but it probably doesn't matter ‚Ä¶ some plugins being available before they should be via direct download only`) so let's play it safe
          * Mark and Stephane update status.jenkins.io to predict downtime for tomorrow and next week

* Digital Ocean:
    * WiP by @lemeurherve , it's going well (fighting with the Terraform process that need to have an improved documentation + updated, and it's the first time that it is used outside jenkins-infra/aws so need some fixes)
    * Status: Works locally, CI job ready, CI builds to be fixed
        * Credentials for the backend configuration file not interpreted
            * Places the credential name instead of value into config file
            * Each configuration reload requires an interactive update
            * Required to set multiline content separately
                * Easier to use string variables rather than file content
                * File is needed for the DigitalOcean docs

* Updatecli:
    * WiP by @smerle on Docker image updates (hashicorp-tools, jenkins-infra/aws) and on kubernetes-management (AWS EC2 agent template updates directly from packer)

* Private AKS cluster:
    * WiP by @dduportal , back from holidays. Focus on the groovy pipeline library

* Service mirrors.jenkins.io
    * Plain HTTP only, legacy service, running on the VM pkg.origin.jenkins.io
    * Pager duty alert the 07th of Feb. about bad TLS certificats: but no HTTPS on it: we removed the alert as it make no sense
    * TODO: decommission this service

* rating.jenkins.io: 
    * WiP by Jeremy Playout (@jplayout)
    * Status: PR opened with the helm chart (from @halkeye's work :heart:)
    * Todo: validate helm chart, and then open PR for installation in kubernetes-management
    * Might need to create a Postgres DB in Azure + migrate data
