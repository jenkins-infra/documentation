## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/125?closed=1):
    * [ACP mirroring configuration prevents usage of external repositories](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4271)
    * [Block user santaender for issue spam](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4269)
    * [Block user rhythmtutu for issue spam](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4268)

    * [Replacing existing stats.jenkins.io code with https://github.com/jenkins-infra/stats.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4265)
        * @lemeurherve to prepare a plan for production
        * Don't forget about credential for file storage
        * Don't forget about blue/green fallback scenario
        * TTL for the plan: 17 Sept.

    * [[get.jenkins.io, azure.updates.jenkins.io] MaxMind GeoIP Rate Limit hit when redeploying/upgrading `mirrorbits` chart](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4240)
        * We want to handle GeoIP database updates without hitting Rate limit or Azure Fileshare SMB errors
        * We are going for a Kubernetes CronJob (need helm chart) in the publick8s cluster (close to mirrorbits instances)
        * With a custom Docker image for this implementation (need geoipupdate CLI and also azcopy CLI)
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Builds stucks due to GH API rate limit](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4165)
        * Fixed the JobDSL "whitespace" issues which were breaking infra.ci following latest @dduportal changes
        * WiP on the JobDSL organization folder implementation
        * Next step: pipeline shared library changes for the way we publish Docker images
    * [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * WiP on JDK17/21 Windows for cert.ci and trusted.ci (Windows SSH agents)

            * We have to check, before brownout, how to detect errors (datadog)
        * In parallel (but lower priority): use mirrorbits CLI on trustedci (instead of kubectl)
            * Excuse to validate use of Azure Private Link Services for Kubernetes internal LBs

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/[ID+1])
    * account issue: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4270
