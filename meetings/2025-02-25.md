## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases

2. Announcements:
    * to follow up with ci.jenkins.io is now in AWS. Few performances issues and hiccups but overall work great (and Azure sponsor credits are not in danger anymore): we rollback to windows VMs instead of kubernetes pods as is was bugging some plugins (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4540 https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4541)
        * leading to the discussion to keep windows container or to embrace windows vm agent https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4554
            * to have the windows containers working we would have to solve problems https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4552 `Paging file too small`
