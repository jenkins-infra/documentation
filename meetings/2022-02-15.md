* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Core Security release last week: Jenkins 2.334 + Jenkins 2.319.3
2. Plugins Security release today (in progress)
3. Weekly 2.335 delayed for tomorrow (16th of February)
    * Changes Linux installer from System V init to systemd
    * Mark wants to write a blog about the change

## Notes :book:

* ci.jenkins.io outage (Linux Container agent failing to allocate) last friday 10th of Feb.
  * https://status.jenkins.io/issues/2022-02-10-agents-not-allocating-ci/
  * Root cause: 
      * AWS required an **additional IAM permission** to allow autoscaling the EKS cluster nodes. No notification, no documentation: not sure how it happened.
      * Symptom: autoscaler component in EKS was logging "Go panic" traces with "Unauthorized 403" error for AWS API
  * Multiple fixes:
      * EKS Terraform module upgraded (with a LOT of breaking changes) hoping that it would help. Spoiler: it did not. But was success though.
          * Faster autoscaling, less resources to pay for (no public IP, etc.)
          * Major version change of the plugin, disruptive shift
      * We found the missing permission and fixed it (thanks @smerle @lemeurherve !!!)
  * TODO:
      * Write a Post Mortem
      * PR to the Terraform EKS module examples/doc to add the new permission
      * Docker Hub credential (see below)
      * Contact AWS support to improve their autoscaler documentation
          * AWS shows less than Terraform
          * Terraform shows less than actual required permissions

* DockerHub API Rate Limit (again)
    * By switching the EKS node pool to private IPS, we were rate-limited (because only 1 egress IP)
    * ci.jenkins.io Kubernetes workload: 
        * Short term fix: add a docker-registry secret in the workspace + specify it
            * Helm chart: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helm-charts/pull/94
            * Deployment to cik8s: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/kubernetes-management/pull/2013
            * ci.jenkins.io updated configuration for pod templates:
            * Consider using the account on the Docker builds
        * Long Term fix proposals: 
            * use Docker images in another repository (mirror?)
            * add a Docker image proxy in the cluster (better perf, avoid storing the credential in a "jenkins-agent" namespace, more resilient when DockrHub down)
            * switch back to public IP for worker nodes (but we pay in $$, configuration, and in allocation time)
    * WiP: datadog was in the same case (because we specify DockerHub's hosted custom images)
        * Short term fix (learning path for @smerle): helm chart that would copy the docker-registry credential to specified namespaces
            * Specify account in one location to be used in all namespaces
        * Long term fix for datadog: stop using DockerHub since datadog provides different sources without rate limit (AWS, GHCR, GCR, etc.)
            * Switch to standard Datadog images

* Digital Ocean
    * Work in progress
    * Cluster is working with a local Jenkins instance
        * Created with Terraform on Digital Ocean https://github.com/jenkins-infra/digitalocean/
    * Need to adjust Puppet configuration of ci.jenkins.io to match
    * Two kubernetes clusters in Jenkins may show new surprises
        * May consider a single control plane with autoscaling to clouds

* Updatecli for terraform
    * @smerle added more tracking with updatecli for Terraform components
    * infra.ci and release.ci have virtual machine templates updated
        * Using same environment on infra.ci and release.ci
        * Moving towards the retirement of trusted.ci
    * Running packer image build
        * Still need to deploy images to a remote registry
            * Moving toward single image on multiple uses (Docker, VM)

* ci.jenkins.io agent upgrade
    * VM templates 0.15.x: JDK 17.0.2 and JDK 8u322-b06
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/releases/tag/0.15.1
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/releases/tag/0.15.0
        * Java release naming pattern changes happen
    * JDK 11.0.14.1 released, needs updates to packer images
        * Need to handle 4 digit pattern in tooling

* Building Docker Images on infra.ci/release.ci
    * release.ci and infra.ci have the full VM Docker capability
    * TODO: update docker build shared library to use it instead of img


* Security of infra.ci
    * Lot of jobs and credentials: need to start "separating" things
        * Deploy web site previews
        * Terraform
        * Puppet
    * TODO: split jobs in folder and move credential per folders
        * Scope credentials by folder
        * Find the jobDSL directive to load the credential
        * Should we move the Netlify preview deployment credential to ci.j.io
        * Could split the Jenkins instance
        * Could use a remote vault system
            * Still accessible by API call to the vault from any job
            * More complicated than we're ready to do now
    * TODO: do not use shared library changelog as in ci.j
    * TODO: disable github check's feedback for sensitive jobs (such as kube or terraforms)

* Alibaba mirror
    * TODO: add the mirror - not yet added to the mirrors

* ci.jenkins.io as code
    * Done: shared library
    * TODO: finish milestone in helpdesk
        * @dduportal working that
    * TODO: matrix 3.0 with casc (instead of groovy "lockbox" init.d) - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2708
    * TODO: fix JDK tools update (s390x + powerPC are always far behind arm) - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2760

* census.jenkins.io: Damien still has to ask Tyler/Olivier about the "what does it do?"
