  * [[crawler (tools metadata generator)] build is failing on trusted.ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2950)
    * Top priority, because it also fails the update-center builds.
  * [[Infra Docker Images] Deprecate img in favor of docker](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2952)

  * [[INFRA-3137] Terraform: Import unmanaged Oracle Cloud resources
](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2682)
    * No work done (yet). Not able to do it next milestone: delayed.
  * [Jenkins Infra Docker Images: build our own Windows images](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2873)
    * It builds, tests, releases!
    * Had to work around Windows VMs (cygwin, git SCM, credentials)

  * [Add an HTTP permanent redirect from https://jenkinsistheway.io to https://stories.jenkins.io/](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2943)
    * httpredirector deployed in Kubernetes and working (when overriding local DNS)
    * Mark and Alyssa have a confirmed access to the GoDaddy registrar to manage the domain.
    * Short term: they put a redirection in GoDaddy. Google links are not broken anymore BUT redirects to the root of the new website.
    * Medium term: a CNAME should be put to `public.aks.jenkins.io` to benefit from our own redirector
    * Long term: retrieve the domain name management to the infra-team
    * Removing this issue from next milestone as Mark is Out of Officie this week
* New/Importants [`infra-team-sync-next`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10)
  * [DockerHub rate limiting ci.jenkins.io triage](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2961)
    * Each wave of dependanbot on jenkinsci/docker hit the API rate limit
    * We are waiting from Docker to apply the "team" plan to our organizations so we should have more API rate limit
    * If the improved rate limit is not enough:
      * Agents with public IP and NO docker login when pulling (rate limit per public IP, but for 6 hours)
      * Or a docker registry in caching mode 
  * [Kubernetes 1.22](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2930)
    * Stephane to continue upgrading kubectl (update issue with the PR on docker-helmfile)
    * Stephane and Herve to start preparing documentation and migration path: should be upgrade DOKS cluster? Any blockers for others in the changelog?
    * Next week: we'll determine the timeline if changelog was read as expected
  * Add access to Google console to Mark, Tim & Herv√©

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/19)
