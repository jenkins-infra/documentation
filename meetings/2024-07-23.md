    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * UC2 new publication has been merged
        * We deliver parallellized publications to 2 different Cloudflare regions (EU and US)
        * We also cleaned up and finished deployment on the HTTPD server (.htaccess only)
        * crawler is also up to date with both new and old UC
        * Next steps:
            * Validate the new UC features
            * Stress test this new UC
            * Start using it ourselves: Docker images (weekly.ci/release.ci and infra.ci)
    * [Add JDK21 agents (build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4124)
        * WiP on ci.jenkins.io: Linux VM inbound agents (JDK17 + JDK21) by @jay and 
            * Vagrant tested
            * PR opened: next step deliver to production
        * Next steps
            * trusted.ci SSH Linux VM agents (require a bit of pre-setup but testeable end to end)
            * Windows (both inbound and SSH) later
    * [[cert.ci.jenkins.io] Jobs failing with `TransportException: github.com:443 failed to respond` when using `git` pipeline step with JGit tool](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4186)
        * JGit with (this specific) private repository failed to clone with TCP errors in a parallel context
        * Patch: using native git CLI on cert.ci
        * Nice to have: setup git tool to have git native CLI as primary tool for all and JGit as fallback
        * Request by Mark in the comments will be treated somewhere else (most probably diagnose / reproduce the bug)
    * [new.stats.jenkins.io slow to load](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4177)
        * We have better performances since gzip and brotli compression
        * Current status is ok for the Infra team
    * [Remove 999999-SNAPSHOT version of Remoting from Artifactory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4173)
        * Under Tim's hands
    * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io] Builds stucks due to GH API rate limit](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4165)
        * Still need to be worked on
    * [[Plugin Health Score] Scores not computed - Getting logs from plugin-health.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4152)
        * Adrien is working on it (but overloaded) as we identified the problematic records in database
    * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
        * No more work on it
        * Stephane checked the LDAP part and have some clues => but holidays incoming
            * We have a link to a similar error (related to LDIF indexing)
            * We identified and fixed the LDAP build for arm64
    * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)
        * WiP, next batch will be Terraform Jobs
        * Herve already created all jobs on infra.ci and prepared a big batch of PRs on repositories
        * Next batch will be Jenkins Infra Docker images
        * GHA -> Jenkins
            * case by case due to need for contributors to see the updatecli builds (at least the diff)
                * run diff on ci.jio and apply on infra.ci? (or another controller)
                * run all on infra.ci and only publish GH checks on PRs
            * Funny side effects by moving from GHA VMs to Jenkins pod agents
            * Need another issue for these cases

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/121)
    * Issue to create about SSH restriction through VPN (AWS and DO)
    * [Temurin JDK upgrade July 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4193)
        * All JDKs seem available
        * Need to cleanup leftovers of EA versions for Jenkins tool on ci.jio for s390x agent
        * Damien will pair with Jay on s390x JDK CLI tools to update (in anticipation of Ansible setup later this year)
        * Reminder by Mark that we have 3 batches:
            * Jenkins JDK tool installes
            * Jenkins Agent JDK installed CLI tool
            * Jenkins Controller and Agents runtimes
    * [Dockerhub rate limit broke the www.jenkins.io CI build](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4192)
        * Looks like it was a one time issue on DockerHub. Fixed by manual reaply on short term
        * However jenkins.io pipeline, on ci.jenkins.io, does not have a `docker login` authentication so it is anonymously pulling. As it uses ruby official image, the rate limit might apply on one of the 3 outbound IPs so this problem might happen again (we moved to NAT gateway a few months ago so it is "recent").
            * We should improve the pipeline
        * Also need to diagnose the ATH failure to see if there are improvement we could make (like for jenkins.io)
    * [ci.j.io plugin jobs don't trigger on branch scan](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4191)
        * Daniel gave all required informations in the issue and is a legit request
        * Need to be announced (as it might create a 1 hour "Scan repo" overload on ci.jio when deploying the new config)
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4194
    * New mirrors to add:
        * [New mirror in Japan](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4194) ready to roll
        * [Adding an new mirror in Taiwan](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4190) ready to roll
        * [Adding an OSSPlanet mirror](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4159) they acknoledged it but the initial rsync is slow (from OSUOSL) => on hold until they give us news
