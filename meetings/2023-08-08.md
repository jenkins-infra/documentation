## Attendees ðŸ‘¥


<!-- Handles are community.jenkins.io handles -->
* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @hlemeur (HervÃ© Le Meur)
* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* @smerle33 (StÃ©phane Merle)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly 2.418
  * Failed during the "Push tag" step due to git
  * Release process restarted as nothing was pushed

2. Next meeting (2023-08-15) **Cancelled**. We'll meet the 22 August 2023 instead

3. Question: Jitsi for meetings?
  * We tried Jitsi for visio. meetings inside Elements.io, both application and website
  * We could run the infra meeting using Jisti instead of Zoom
  * Recording can be done with a Youtube account (with the "live record" feature)
      * Need to be enabled 24 hours before (1 time)
      * Alternative with OBS studio (but local record)
      * Let's ask the board for the youtube liverecord
      * Would avoid the "upload recording step"

## Upcoming Calendar ðŸ“†

* Next Weekly: 2.419, the 15th August 2023
* Next LTS: 2.414.1 (RC 9th of August) the 23 of August (backports done, one last UI regression reported though)
