[ðŸ§  Previous Meeting Notes](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation/blob/main/meetings/2022-01-11.md)

## Attendees

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @lemeurherve (HervÃ© Le Meur)
* @MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)
* @smerle33 (Stephane Merle)

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. LTS released last week
2. Weekly released last week
    * Weekly triggered unexpectedly on Tuesday
    * Jenkins infra has [an issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2727) to resolve the root cause
4. 20+ plugins released
5. Weekly in progress today
    * Includes process improvements
6. Damien needs someone else to run the meeting next week
    * @lemeurherve volunteers

## Notes :book:

* Certificate for repo-ci.jenkins.org updated (thanks KK :heart:)
    * Updated and running the new certificate
    * Documentation in the runbook, entry in the calendar
* Netlify for plugins.jenkins.io, status.jenkins.io and jenkins.io
    * Previews visible for www.jenkins.io and plugins.jenkins.io PR's
    * Still need to migrate status.jenkins.io to the open source account
        * Already hosted on Netlify, but in a user account
        * Open source account allows multiple administrators
    * Deployment preview happens and runs from infra.ci.jenkins.io
        * Advanced check that maps to deployments
    * Web site is built by infra.ci using specific Pipeline libraries
        * Pushed by Netlify command line, but using Jenkins, not Netlify CI
        * Limited by amount of minutes on Netlify CI free credits
        * We do the build on our machines, then use their hosting
* rating.jenkins.io: The apache version + OS is shown by rating.jenkins.io
  * Fixed by Herve earlier, there was one left Docker image change to apply
  * Required a new updatecli manifest in jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra
  * Docker images now build automatically
      * Can use updatecli to use those new container versions
  * Well suited to migrate rating.jenkins.io to Kubernetes

* Digital Ocean: @lemeurherve started to work on it
  * Path 1: Kubernetes cluster (managed by Terraform) with 2 node. Target: ci.jenkins.io Linux container workloads (out from EKS), tracked in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2651
      * Using as supplementary agents for ci.jenkins.io
  * Path 2 (to be done) VM agent for ci.jenkins.io (suggested by Gavin if Kubernetes costs us too much in maintenance time). Requires packer template + plugin digital ocean on Jenkins
      * Alternative if needed
  * Part of the Digital Ocean sponsorship, will need a blog post
      * Logo not yet visible on www.jenkins.io home page

* Packer Images: building Docker images by @smerle33
  * Linux Container OK for build
      * Developers should not care whether a virtual machine or container
      * JDK 8, JDK 11, git, Maven, etc.
      * Use packer to build all images (Docker container, AWS VM, Azure VM)
      * Won't need the inbound agent image for Jenkins infra
      * Image build is working
  * Need to
      * add the "deploy phase"
      * swap ci.jenkins.io's container images with these new packer's images
      * then Windows container


* Release process
    * [One container per pod](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/issues/201) => avoid Kubernetes timeout
        * Testing today in the weekly release 2.331
    * [JDK11](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/issues/199) => modernization
    * [Windows packaging](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/issues/212) => for a 30 min package build, 15 min of pulling windows dotnet image (12-15 Gb) + 5-6 min of windows...
    * @basil (Basil Crow) started a huge work on jenkinsci/packaging to provide more testing BEFORE release (enabling CI, etc.). Why not moving most of the docker-packaging's Dockerfile content in jenkinsci/packaging? (docker-packaging should only add the inbound-agent logic for kube + specific release script tooling such as `jv` or `updatecli`)
    * Stop using branches on jenkins-infra/release repository (discussion on community.jenkins.io to be started)
        * First step to staging releases before the real release

* Jfrog repo.jenkins-ci.org
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2733

* Safety checks on weekly release to be done (because recent changes)
    * @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag to trigger the subject on IRC #jenkins-release.

<!-- Delayed to next week -->
<!--
* Work on the private cluster
  * Need to finish the "terraform shared library" to ensure AWS, datadog, DO and Azure have the same behavior

* Building Docker Images on infra.ci/release.ci
  * Docker Linux AMD64: move from "docker-less" to docker VMs

* infra.ci's credentials
* ci.jenkins.io timeouts for aws-secrets-manager-secret-source & aws-secrets-manager-credentials-provider plugins
    * https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/h6klfdeM8tM

* census.jenkins.io: Damien *still* has to ask Tyler/Olivier about the "what does it do?"
* Day 2 day operations:
  * Disable anti spam for cert team: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2703
  * Move ci.jenkins.io auth (since matrix-auth-plugin 3.0) config to CasC: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2708
  * Tsinghua University mirror investigation completed (not an issue with their infrastructure): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/5 (first issue after helpdesk opening, already proving its value)
