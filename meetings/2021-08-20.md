## Notes :book:

* [ci.jenkins.io] Migration from ACI to EKS
    * Used container instances on ci.jenkins.io for maven
    * Many issues previously, expensive to use
    * Moving to kubernetes agents instead of ACI
    * Major milestone - using k8s agents on ci.jenkins.io
    * Kubernetes cluster on AWS running now
    * Adding more Kubernetes clusters on other providers
    * Updated runbooks and documentation
    * Pipeline library needs an update
        * Soft deprecate the `useAci` parameter
        * Add `useContainer` parameter
        * Submit pull requests to many repositories
        * Add a pull request checker for `useAci` parameter
    * Cost reduction progress
        * 50 machine maximum autoscaling
        * Datadog showed that we never reached more than 36 based on the autoscaler
        * Indicates we will be able to use multiple clusters
    * Build times are a little slower than ACI
* [archives.jenkins.io] Rackspace is deprecated in favor of oracle cloud
    * Replacement is working very well
    * Correctly listed as a mirror
    * Dramatically cheaper - $800 -> $60 per month
        * Bandwidth charges seem biggest difference
        * Slow download for Tim Jacomb and Mark Waite
        * Was much faster earlier
* Cost information update
    * Updated the sheet
    * Azure costs decreasing from $13k back to $10k
        * Cleaned some old instances on Azure
    * Amazon costs increasing
    * Looking at possible savings on the AWS account
        * Some EC2 instances may be too large
        * AWS cost explorer reports may not be as helpful until end of month
    * Cost of AWS instances can reduce by changing storage
        * Same instance size, EBS volume instead of SSD
        * Need to monitor memory and CPU usage of highmem
        * Considering making the highmem label exclusive
* Package Images
    * Docker inbound agent build with packer
        * Maven upgrades changed in a single location
        * Java upgrades in a single location
        * More "all in one" templates
    * Docker transition to Java 11
        * Docker agent build needs work
        * Docker inbound agent build needs work
        * Docker ssh (outbound) agent build needs work
* s390x IBM is interested to participate
* LFX platform security v2 dashboard
    * Write permission to jenkins-infra will allow access
    * Intentionally selected subset of git repos
