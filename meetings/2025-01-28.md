## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last week: 2.494 released with no issues
    * This Week: 2.495 started on time today
2. Reminder: no weekly team meeting next week (Feburary 4, 2025). Next one is the 11.
3. Azure Outages impacting Container Instances
    * The [Infra/"homemade" ATH](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/job/acceptance-tests/job/check-agent-availability/) has not reported errors on the `maven-8-windows` since a few days
    * Proposal: revert label to use ACI and close the issue
4. We had a security advisory (plugins only) last week
    * Minor issue with the new UC: the JenSec script was assuming all files have the same "Last-Modified" header which changed.
        * Daniel issued a fix in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/835
    * Our runbooks need updates (post mortem with Kevin):
        * Runbook "trusted.ci":
            * Clarify how to choose why putting the SSH public key in a hieradata or the other
            * Clarify if the group "sudo" is needed or not
            * Clarify that an RSA 4096 or ECDSA key is needed
            * Describe the Windows + WSL "hosts" file to change (both Windows and WSL)
        * Runbook "updates.jenkins.io"
            * Remove SSH access (and any "legacy") element
        * Runbook "pkg.origin.jenkins.io"
            * Create it!
            * Define the SSH access with "pkg.origin.jenkins.io" as entrypoint
            * Add a note that it "used" to host updates.jio
        * Runbook "Security":
            * Make it point to the runbook "ci.jenkins.io" to avoid duplicating information
            * Make it point to the new pkg.origin (instead of updates.jio) 
            * Use "ci.jenkins.io" for both SSH and HTTP endpoints (instead of private hostnames) to anticipater for AWS migration
5. Artifactory Storage: Jfrog asked us to decrease disk space used
    * Goal: from ~9.8Tb to <5Tb
    * We have only 2 Artifactory admins. We're going to temporarily grant admin permissions to Darin Pope if JenSec team is ok,so he can lead this process
        * Led by Mark, and executed by Darin
    * 2 phases:
        * Incrementals artifacts (e.g. builds from PR or branches used for early testing) are never deleted today. If we start deleting all of them older than 4 weeks, we should save more than 1Tb of storage.
        * Reducing the "mirror" cache size
            * Deletion of unused cached (e.g. not in "public")
            * Some of the mirrors (mainly atlassian public mirror) should be shrinked to decrease the usage
    * Mark meets with JFrog tomorrow and will report during the Contributor summit
