## Notes :book:


* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/81?closed=1):

  * [A few SSL certificates expire in 17 days or less](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3748)
  * [Unexpected long delay uploading BOM artifact s3 bucket](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3745)
  * [[INFRA-3154] Certain emails from Jenkins mailing lists are failing SPF](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2696)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/81?closed=1):
  * [After creating ID, I am not allowed to sign in](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3752)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/81):
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * CloudFlare accepted to sponsors us \o/
      * We can use their R2 (S3-like) service and DNS zone/records
      * Terraform project to manage CloudFlare resources is being boostraped
          * "Tf-State" private project to create states and APi tokens for staging/product
          *  WiP on starting public jenkins-infra/cloudFlare project to run on infra.ci
      * We are creating at least 2 initial buckets to cover 2 different geographic zones in the world to have multiple mirrors
      * Refocused to Cloudflare, which means we are delaying DigitalOcean mirror initialization until we have a working service with CF to avoid spreading our effort
  * [Assess Artifactory bandwidth reduction options](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3599)
      * We have the logs from JFrog, but not yet analyzed
      * maven-hpi-plugin: still wip on fixing ITs. Issues with mrm-plugin not merging settings.xml as expected. Might need to opt-out from ACP for this one on short term
      * Next meeting with JFrog: ? (to be checked)
  * [[`publick8s`] Ensure high availability of replicated services](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3719)
      * Anti-affinity did not solve the HA problem as expected (no autoscaling triggered from 1 to 2 nodes on arm64)
      * Also tried with PodDisruptionBudget: same (had effect as expected but not on the autoscaler)
      * Proposal: Let's set the arm64 nodepool to minimum 2 nodes to achieve HA.
          * Eventually to the Intel node pool as well
      * Proposal 2: lets keep the effort to add anti-affinity and PDB to all replicated service for better QoS
  * [Remove account request field from Jira login page](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3735)
  * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
      * On hold in favor of the HA topic (as discussed last week) + Pipeline Library optim
      * Back to backlog
  * [Matomo github/docker repos](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3602)
      * MySQL instance: Drafted a PR and added question, waiting from team feedback
      * Image: on hold

* New issues:
  * [Ensure removed jenkins.io pages aren't accessible and indexed anymore](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3360)
      * Old issues back to life :zombie: 
      * Caused issues on jenkins.io recently (old pages still there causing mayhem)
      * Goal: add the `--delete` flag to the blobxfer deployment command
      * We were scared to loose content. In consequence:
          * Snapshot was done to backup the data: it is a backup policy done daily
              * Gotta check the cost in a week to eventually change frequency
          * List of files that "would be" deleted if we applied the change
      * Related issue with the backend-extension-indexer
          * Already broken so removing jenkins.io old pages shouldn't be a problem
          * Discussion between maintainer is leading to a probable backend-extension-indexer deactivation
      * Next steps:
          * Another back and forth with another maintainer to be 100% sure
          * Identified risk on the filename case
          * Let's plan this with docs people AND infra team
  * [Speed up the Docker image library to create/push tags at the same time for both GH and Docker (instead of running additional build)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3751)
      * Next step of Stephane's work on the pipeline library with Docker Bake
      * Goal: simplify the 2 builds-process of our current "main build -> push latest and git tag -> trigger tag build -> push tagged image"
          * Less time to completion
          * Less GitHub API calls
      * Problem: how to handle git tag triggering?
      * Let's go without the triggering tag process
  * [Mirrorstats report wrong results](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3136)
  * (Issue to be created) Hacktoberfest (doc, labels, process)
  * (Issues to be created) Transition from Oracle Cloud
    * Oracle cloud's donation period has ended, they are now charging us for archives.jenkins.io
    * Mark identifying process to pay the current Oracle cloud bill
    * Need ticket to move archives.jenkins.io from Oracle Cloud to another location
        * Azure, DigitalOcean?
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3760 (OSUOSL)
    * Other machines on our Oracle cloud account are terminated
    * Once transition is complete, we can close the Oracle cloud account for Jenkins infra
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3761

* Java support / 2+2+2
    * Google sheet with [Java support diagram for Jenkins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc-0yuYOD5u674qnxbPOWhCU5t9viCJukVj_9b-kwAw/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Google doc with proposed [Java support plan for Jenkins](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3RVlniNmz-5Nd3LI-w58LDf760Ai7FqssP4zHuTv8U/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Discussions already raised with board and officers

        * Details in [recording at 14:23](https://youtu.be/KKzfWJtkv04?t=863)
    * Upcoming discussions in developer list and user list
    * Basil Crow preparing a blog post for early October
        * Announce Java 21 support
        * Announce Java 11 end of life in Oct 2024
        * Announce 2+2+2 Java support plan for Jenkins
    * Proposal for infra:
        * First start with the JDK21 official release
        * Then remove JDK19 remnants
        * Then focus on JDK21 for our production controllers/agents

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/82)
