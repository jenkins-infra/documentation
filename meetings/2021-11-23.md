## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Announcement
    * Weekly release 2.322 is running

## Notes :book:


* Weekly Release failure:
  * `gpg` absent
  * Reduced the size of our Docker images
      * Implicit dependency on `gpg` package
      * Checking for other implicit dependencies (`ssl`, `git`)
      * Since we're not using tagged images, can't use last week's image
* jenkins.io outage
  * Due to nginx helm-chart 1.0.5 (patch version but broke ingress rule)
      * Side effect from a security fix in nginx
      * Deleted the ingress rule for www.jenkins.io
      * CVE fix forbids certain configuration like `if` block
      * Moved the image configuration to a higher level
  * postmortem
      * Will start a postmortem hackmd.io document (edit after meeting: https://hackmd.io/VFHwqgZ6QBq-Jt_Dqa42Vg)
      * Collect comments and questions for 7 days
      * After 7 days, freeze the document to https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation/blob/main/postmortem/20211118-jenkinsio-outage.md
      * Will update status.jenkins.io with status
* TLS cert for repo.jenkins-ci.org
  * KK has everything needed but has not responded to Jfrog yet
* Kubernetes 1.20 upgrade
  * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3118
  * @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ Reviewed the Kubernetes changelogs
      * Default timeout period now set to 1 second
      * Was previously 1 second, but a bug caused the default to be ignored
          * Default will be honored now
      * See the upgrade notes for details
  * Plan to upgrade this week (possibly Thursday or Friday)
  * Announce the upgrade and likely downtime
* Pipeline Library for Terraform
  * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3132
      * May be interest from ATARC in that Terraform library
  * Hashicorp Terraform Cloud (free tier including 5 users)
      * Can we import Terraform state in HCT Cloud?
* ci.jenkins.io:
  * Maven 3.8.4 + Git 2.34 almost available (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/packer-images/tree/0.10.0)
  * Azure Windows 2019 failing: still ok to publish?
  * Maven 3.8.3 binaries are not available for download
* "Docker Pipeline Library + updatecli 0.15.0" campaign: some leftovers:

  * Goal: Reduce AWS costs to under USD $8000 per month
* Elections voting system is offline
  * [CIVS server](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) offline due to hardware failure
