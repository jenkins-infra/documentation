## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Last team meeting (2024-03-26) was cancelled due to Update Center outages
    * See issue ["Check if we could replace `blobxfer` by `azcopy`"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414) below for details
2. Weekly (2.451)
    * Available last week
    * Package step failed due to Update Center outage? Fixed ~2 hours after the "packaging" job was completed (had to cancel it and run the "sync mirror" steps manually)
3. Weekly (2.452)
    * Release and Packages good on first try :+1: 
        * Mirrors are picking the installers: https://get.jenkins.io/windows/2.452/jenkins.msi?mirrorlist
    * Docker image had issue but is available
        * Windows :+1: at first try
        * Linux failed twice due to Docker HTTP/429 errors, but replays of Linux only solved the problem
        * Ready to deploy!
    * Changelog: [published!](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/#v2.452)

4. DockerHub API Rate limit (HTTP/429)
    * We have HTTP/429 since 23 March 2024
    * It impairs our ability to deliver Jenkins images (core - weekly, LTS and security releases, and agents)
    * Trusted.ci only has 1 outbound IP. Multiple IPs to add for this (short term).
    * We need an issue (the problem is not ephemeral)
    * 2nd email to Docker OSS program: waiting for an answer until next week

5. Jenkins infra and `xz` CVE
    * We are not affected on the platform (Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 22.04)
