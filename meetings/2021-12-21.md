## Attendees

* @smerle (Stephane Merle)

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. No infra meeting next week: see each other in 2022
2. Jenkins weekly release 2.326

## Notes :book:

* Note: renamed jenkins-infra/charts to jenkins-infra/kubernetes-management, and jenkins-infra/public-charts to jenkins-infra/helm-charts
* Azure Kubernetes (publick8s cluster) has service IP subnet overlapping with the global network (alert in the portal: https://portal.azure.com/#@azure.jenkins.io/resource/subscriptions/dff2ec18-6a8e-405c-8e45-b7df7465acf0/resourceGroups/prodpublick8s/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/prodpublick8s/aksDiagnostics)
    * As per the docuementation, the service IP range must be outside the virtual net: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni#deployment-parameters
    * As per https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/47617, we cannot update this CIDR on an existing cluster: we need to create a new one to fix this issue
    * It could be a great opportuniy to create privatek8s (in a private nerwork as per https://github.com/jenkins-infra/iep/tree/master/iep-002)
    * then migrate publick8s once it is not hosting private services anymore :)
    * Terraform? (nice to have but not strictly required)
    * Damien to send an email to the mailing list to discuss this. proposed timeline: January 2022
* Netlify:
    * Initial goal: use it for site preview on pull requests
        * Alternative (or complement!) to consider: JenkinsX cluster
    * Gavin asked for an OpenSource sponsoring (allows for more than 1 personal account)
    * Targets:
        * status.jenkins.io (prod + PRs)
        * plugins.jenkins + jenkins.io (PRs)
    * Should be OK but they request a logo on the jenkins.io
        * Discussion to bring to the board about wether or not to use Netlify, where to put logo, what to write, etc.
        * Request from Gavin to evaluate the bandwidth consumed on jenkins.io
