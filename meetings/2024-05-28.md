## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/113?closed=1):
    * [ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de blocked](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4096)
    * [Packer-Images: bug within updatecli to update goss since exclusion of windows 2019 for vsstudio](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4090)
      * YAML syntax error making `updatecli` fail (Go template inside the yaml, used by Goss) preventing us to create dependency bump PRs since 4 weeks
      * Updatecli fixed by changing the YAML parser (short term fix). Allowed us to release new image versions
      * Goss syntax fixes to make the YAML valid: opportunity to add a "failfast" and correct error code: now if goss fail on Windows, then the pipeline fail \o/
    * [[ci.jenkins.io] Migrate ci.jenkins.io EKS clusters out from CloudBees AWS account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3954)
      * Only cleanup was left: done!
      * We see the decrease on AWS (CloudBees) and DO bills while consuming in Azure (sponsored account)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/113?closed=1):
    * [sparshev account is unavailable in issues.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4103)
    * [Blocked by mirror, unable to update plugins.](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4102)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/113):
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Handover from @lemeurherve to @smerle done (thanks!)
        * Done:
            * Designed the next steps around production architecture:
                * Cloudflare R2: we already have a West-Europe bucket, we need a second one in US-East (same as PKG vm) to provide better latency for US users
                * OSUOSL VMs: if Cloudflare fails (whatever reason) we need a fallback. We have 2 unused VMs, with enough resources (CPU/Memory/disk) to be used for this use case
                * In case of terrible problem, we also can spin up a VM in DigitalOcean for fallback/alternative
            * Credentials for Azure HTTPD (new) - bucket tested with success! 
        * Wip:
            * update-center2: we expect 4 PRs (1 already in draft)
                * Abstract away the environment (bucket URLs/credentials) from the `publish.sh` script to allow real life testing without impacting production and manage multiple sync targets per "kind " (e.g. rsync/azcopy/s3/R2) => @dduportal 
                * Adding the azcopy httpd sync support (Draft already there) => everyone
                * New R2 bucket to be added => @smerle 
                * Later: OSUOSL VMs (rsync)
    * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by RCS&RDS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4003)
        * They still need to add HTTPS on their server (and give us credentials for sync) => pinged them, still waiting
    * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by Hostico](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3976)
        * Done:
            * Verified that we can specify user and password in the FTP or RSYNC inline URL (ftp://user:password@hostname/path for instance)
        * WiP:
            * Waiting for them to re-enable their FTP or rsync => @dduportal once they answer
    * [Packaging job on ci.jenkins.io never completes - retries fail](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4106)
        * Root cause: cluster change to Azure on ci.jenkins.io
        * Wip:
            * PR on the project to unblock the pod allocation
            * Choice: merge pod template definition between admin-defined and developer defined for this particular one (packaging Docker image in,stead of all in one) => @dduportal with @smerle 
    * [ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de got blocked ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4105)
        * Closeable as C-Otto responded
    * [packer-images: git version not always available simultaneously on apt ppa for arm64 and amd](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4100)
        * Proposal: we are experimenting compiling our own git instead of relying on packages (wether ubuntu or PPA) which is safer.
        * WiP:
            * Compilation work very well and is really fast
            * Problem: on VMs, the meta-package `ubuntu-server` has `git` as a direct dependency
                * Solution 1: let's override the `git` package even if present. Need exhaustive file override and might lead the package tree broken.
                * Solution 2: build our own deb package as a post-step of compilation
            * Cleanup of unused build dependencies
            * Updatecli manifest
 
    * [Request Temporal "Admin Read" Access for https://ci.jenkins.io/](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4095)
        * Carlos want to run a "Jenkins Cloud-Friendly" talks in June. He wanted to show different CNCF/Cloud-Native projects linked to a real life Jenkins instance.
        * Damien met Carlos, an we're going to share links to the "public" setup we have for a few elements:
            * Azure VM and Azure Container based agents
            * Kubernetes agents
            * Former EC2 setup
            * Datadog setup
        * If needed we'll meet to record Damien's screen to give him more material
        * Note: with their Jenkins account, he can show builds logs with Pod template agent definition
  
    * [Add `.war.asc` to get.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4055)
        * WiP by Mark and Basil

    * [migrate storage from premium to standard for jenkins-infra, jenkins-weekly and jenkins-release](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4044)
        * We changed Kubernetes volume from "Dynamic Provisioning" to "Static Provisioning" to control the disk (in Azure API) and its attributes such as type
        * We had to create a "dummy" storage class to ensure PV and PVC statically provisionned have the same "storage class" value (not empty and not default)
        * Next steps: plan operation with the rsync migration (preparation involved) => @smerle 
  
    * [[Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org)] perform a systematic audit of all non-plugin  artifacts in our `releases` repository to identify and quarantine unused artifacts](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4034)
        * Nothing done (on Damien to send email)

* New issues:
    * Maven 3.9.7 => need an issue @dduportal 
    * Start discussion about Jenkins core release with JDK17 and Maven 3.9.x => issue (@dduportal and @markewaite)
    * NPM Jenkins account - MFA => https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4073 => @lemeurherve 
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3923 => @smerle to see (least priority)
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2833 => @dduportal with Jay as secondary

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/114)
