## Notes :book:

            * Spam are still happening some times. Migration to GH would help. Using keycloakd for account-app as well.
        * [SAML plugin is not yet available on get.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4853)
    * ci.jenkins.io issues:

            * Merging Suse and RPM packages proposal: https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/pull/430 => SIG packaging

            * Impacts on users with API tokens: reset on each restart
