  * [I am not able to create a new user account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3675)
      * Let's check Datadog's logs for AccountApp (even if account has been created) -> @lemeurherve
  * [Forum enhancements](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3665)
  * [Rename `pipeline-log-fluentd-cloudwatch-plugin-developers`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3669)
  * [Cannot download the jenkins war file and plugins](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3661)
  * [Jira upgrade broke comment sort order remembering and implies an insane default](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3658)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/74?closed=1):
  * [Jenkins Account Creation issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3668)
  * [Password forgot ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3667)

  * [Password reset](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3666)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/74):
  * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3582)
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Removed all the Oracle Cloud resources
      * New goal is to see if we can use R2 CloudFlare
          * Benefits: China projection, cheap for outbound bandwidth (no egress fees), multiple locations, full S3 compliant
      * Plan: use Apache based service in `publick8s` serving `.htaccess` and HTML files generated by trusted.ci + store the Update Center JSON in R2 (with an HTTP redirectin)
          * Would enable HA
          * Read only htdocs means safer service
      * Q: Do we have agreement from Cloudflare to be sponsored as Open Source organization?
          * We are evaluating with the free-tiers and we'll apply once we are sure we'll use them
      * Longer term: we can use another "Mirror redirector" (such as mirrorbits, like for `get.jenkins.io`) with our own mirrors to project on different networks
  * [Artifact caching proxy is unreliable](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3481)
      * Closeable: waiting for final confirmation from developers
  * [Jenkins server is unable to download plugins from the https://updates.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3676)
      * User have to contact Aachen university: nothing else from us (except keeping the issue open, and check again 2 weeks from now)
  * [Issue while creating Jenkins infrastructure account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3677)
      * Short term: create their account to unblock (plugin adopter)
      * Long term: let's check the logs to see if anything is weird with accountapp
  * [ATH builds commonly become unresponsive](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3673)
      * spot disabled for 1 week: let's check the result
      * Let's work on a GC (VM > 24h to be removed)
  * [Disallow issue creation in 'EVENTS' project type](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3671)
      * Todo @dduportal
  * [Jenkins CI failing for jenkins plugin after changes in jenkinsfile to update jenkins.version](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3670)
      * We need reporter to answer our questions: let's ping them
  * [Assess Artifactory bandwidth reduction options](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3599)
      * Last discussions led to the maven central could be used as "fallback" 
      * If it works with the proposed solution from James, next step will be the next step
      * Q: do we need the "password protected" mirror in Artifactory?
          * Yes: in our infra for reliability, but password is hidden inside ACP (not inside ci.jenkins.io ;)
  * [[ci.jenkins.io] ATH builds failing due to denied outbound requests during tests](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3664)
      * Closeable

  * [Ubuntu 22.04 upgrade campaign](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2982)
      * VM pkg is the next priority
          * update.jenkins.io service by @lemeurherve 
          * pkg.origin.jenkins.io by @dduportal 
  * [LF status page redirect may be cached for too long](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3660)
      * @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag takes care of it

* New items (triage and consider adding the next milestone)
  * [AKS cluster publick8s: move Public IPs to a distinct Resource Group than the node pools](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3660)
  * [The mirrors.jenkins-ci.org is missing some necessary metadata files, which prevents it from being added as an apt/yum repo]()
      * Comment that it's blocked by the update/pkg operation, then backlog
  * [Garbage Collector on the ci-jenkins-io-artifacts S3 storage account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3663)

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/75)
