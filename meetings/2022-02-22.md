## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly 2.335 released last week
2. Weekly 2.336 today

## Notes :book:

* Digital Ocean :party:
  * Cluster integrated and used on ci.jenkins. No visible error and some usage.
  * ~30 jobs currently runnings \o/
  * Costs: to be check after 1 week how much did we consume on our credit

  * New labels on ci.jenkins if you want to target (or avoid) a specific cluster (`doks` or `cik8s`)
  * TODO:
      * Email to mailing list?
      * Measure costs consumed
      * Updating ci.jenkins.io documentation for agents
      * DigitalOcean sponsorship
          * Are they on the sponsor page? (nope, they should)
          * We have a blog post to start

* Azure AKS clusters
    * Teraform shared lib :white_check_mark: 
    * Next step: "re-boot" jenkins-infra/azure with:
        * Remove existing terraform/scripts/code content (not used since months and only partially true as drift occured)
        * Use new terraform tooling (shared-tools + shared library)
        * Add a new azurerm backend (new one to avoid inheriting existing ones)
        * Start adding clusters and profit

* Keep our dependencies up to date
    * All our "hashicorp" repositories are now tracked and up to date
    * WiP on keeping Golang up to date (update / golang should both be present)
    * Incoming contributions to updatecli in order to improve infra as code use case (ex. "retrieve security group id from terraform project, and change them in JCasc")

* AccountApp/Keycloak: 
    * We need to assess the "what is missing to fully migrate to Keycloak"
        * accountapp sends the password in clear by email to user reseting
        * It's an "homemade" application: costs us maintenance
    * On "pure" infra there are the following points:
        * Keycloak major upgrade to 17.0.0 (switch from wildfly to quarkus: faster, smaller memory footprint)
        * Keycloak stability: it crashes after 2-3 request. We have to check the app configuration + helm-chart config + memory allocation
        * Keycloak is hosted on the cluster `produpublick8s`. Shall we move it to `*privatek8s` and if yes, how to handle the public ingress?
    * Based on discussions with Daniel:
        * User naming rules that need to be improved
            * https://forge.liiib.re/indiehost/tech/keycloak-themes/-/blob/ddd213e839f96bc3e60ee11945c123557bd6e022/Dockerfile ? (from @lemeurherve )
        * Matrix 3.0 plugin remove a big point
    * Which other tools had been studied for this?
        * Dex, others?
        * Let's ask Daniel, Wadeck and Olivier

* Request from security team to add Windows agent on cert-ci
    * cert-ci is puppet-managed: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/blob/production/manifests/site.pp#L144-L147
    * We have to update the hieradata for cert-ci (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/blob/production/hieradata/clients/cert-ci.yaml) to:
        * Add the azure-vm plugin
        * Add the same agent specification as trusted.ci to allow Windows VM agents (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/blob/production/hieradata/clients/trusted-ci.yaml#L31-L71)
        * Maybe factorizing the agent profiles from "hieradata specified" to "JCasc" so we don't need to specify it per Jenkins instance
    * We have to add the Azure credentials in cert-ci manually (as there is no credential management as code easily done)
        * Scope: only system, not in pipelines!
    * @smerle volunteers
        * Warning: additional VPN route need to access it

* Disable anti spam for cert team: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2703
        
* Mark Waite blocked a ci.jenkins.io API spammer at the Linux kernel
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2759
    * What should we do now? fail2ban? [crowdsec](https://crowdsec.net) to get crowd-funded denied IPs list?
    * Let's check and remove the manual blocker (if not already done due to VM reboots and iptable not persisted)
    * @dduportal takes it

* Email on the mailing list (Google groups) are marked as spam
    * We thought it was fixed but no
    * Issue to reopen and add technical elements: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2696

* IRC notifs - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/2067
    * Puppet notifications => @dduportal and @lemeurherve 
    * infra.ci notifications => same channel as puppet?
    * release.ci notifications => as Tim and Daniel suggested, when a release starts and finishes

* infra-report to be migrated out from trusted.ci into infra.ci
    * Helpdesk issue:
    * switching GH credentials to GitHub app (`jenkinsadmin` user was used, but its permissions were decreased in December) 

* Alibaba mirror
    * Is it working?
    * Helpdesk issue to be checked (might be other mirrors also): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2787
