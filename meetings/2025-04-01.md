## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.503 was released successfully (package failed due to OSUOSL slowness: finished manually) - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$vlgPBijxYoG6QUzUX57pYLg9tJaWoymJCRtoFJR03II?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
    * This Week: 2.504 is delayed to tomorrow (Wednesday April 2) as it will be part of to security advisory - https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories/c/gjEkmc02cU0
2. Security Advisory tomorrow on Core releases (both weekly 2.504 and LTS 2.492.3) - https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories/c/gjEkmc02cU0
    * Proposed 2.504 as next LTS baseline, agreed by Tim Jacomb
3. 2025 Cloud Usage: we might not reach the end of year if neither Amazon and Microsoft renew their sponsorships.
    * Tracked in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4618
    * Short term proposal: let's move ci.jenkins.io back to Azure until end of May. It will delay usage of AWS credits and allows us to go up to end of September
    * Other proposals in the issue to decrease spending in Azure CDF to anticipate after May
    * We should start searching for another sponsor(s) (better safe than sorry)
