    * [[AWS] Move ci.jenkins.io from Azure (sponsorship) to AWS (sponsorship)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4313)
        * [[ci.jenkins.io] Move ephemeral VM agents to AWS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4316)
            * WiP on packer-images to create Linux AMIs for ephemeral agents (using EC2) + GC of AWS resources
            * Next: Windows AMIs and optimizations (security, etc.)
            * Start adding EC2 plugin on ci.jenkins.io
        * [[ci.jenkins.io] Define virtual networking for AWS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4320)
            * packer is out of this scope
            * WiP on creating the VPC, subnets, gateways, etc.
                * Using same terraform module as in the past
                * The module only support, today, 1 public egress IP per gateway
                * But there is an opened PR (from this summer): let's start with 1 public IP per subnet (module's default): 1 for controller, 1 for VM agents and 1 for container agents
                * Another discovery: we need a public subnet for  hosting the NAT gateway to allow internet egress (while resources will stay in private subnet)
            * Looks good: incoming optim. on security groups, but foundation is good for starting the VMs within
    * [infra-statistics has no new data since July 1st 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4285)

            * Image and script are readey to roll
            * WiP on the helm chart and setting up Azure SP for credentials
        * Delaying as Stephane is on day off

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/132)
