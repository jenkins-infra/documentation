## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Announcement
    * 2.338 release has completed, no issue detected during release process (Mark to run release)
    * 2.332.1 LTS release tomorrow with UI improvements, core library updates
        * Cathy Chan is the release lead, with Tim Jacomb as release officer

## Notes :book:

* Testing Github Milestone to gather infra issues for meeting notes
    * Current milestone: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/3
    * Adding a milestone for each new week, this could be an easy way to get together all issues/subjects we're dealing with as we go along
    * Current process:
        * Create a milestone for the current week
        * When creating/updating an issue, set its milestone
        * When preparing the meeting notes, consult these issues
        * During the meeting notes, ???
        * After the meeting notes, not sure closing the milestone would add something, TBD
    * Limitation, the milestones can concern one repository only
        * A: Let's ensure that we create 1 issue on helpdesk per "top level subject"
    * TODO: @lemeurherve 

* infra.ci cron trigger are not working since the 26th of feb
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2803
    * Hotfix: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/315
    * Long term fix: separate our "mono" pipeline into multiple ones, see subpoint of "infra-reports" below

* Azure Portal management
    * Tim underlined [Microsoft security defaults article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) for a "single click to enforce MFA"
        * => Damien

* Nginx-ingress & cert-manager upgrade
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2809

* Failed deployment on Azure prodpublick8s cluster due to a missing Service Principal
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2810

* [Infra-reports](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports)
    * The github-permissions script returned an incomplete report since the Github bot user used for it has its permissions downgraded in December 2021: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2788
    * The github-permissions script now use a Github App instead of a Github bot user:
        * Updated the script to retrieve an Installation Access Token from the Github App private key and identifier: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/pull/32
        * The script has its dedicated Github App `jenkins-infra-reports`, installed on the jenkinsci github organization with "Metadata: Read-only" as unique permission
        * A mechanism to generate a new token every once in a while had to be implemented as an Installation Access Token of a Github App expires after 1 hour: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/pull/33
    * <strike>A shared pipeline to retrieve this kind of access token is currently in progress: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/318</strike> => https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/04/16/github-app-authentication/#how-do-i-get-an-api-token-in-my-pipeline
        * Use https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/github-app.adoc instead of recreating it in a shared pipeline
        * We'll be able to replace github bot user token credentials with this shared pipeline so we won't have to rewrite scripts or services depending on it, like for example:
            * the [fork-report script](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/tree/master/fork-report) of the same repository
            * updatecli
        * For scripts/services needing a longer token, they'll have to be rewrited to be able to generate one on their own from the Github App private key & identifier
        * We'll be able to decommission the Github bot user, and not suffer from changes of its permissions
    * The task of separating the pipeline running the 4 scripts of infra-reports in independant pipelines is in progress: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/issues/35
        * Great Guinea pig for the kind of work we intend to do on all other (shared) pipelines in order to separate main tasks from maintenance ones (like updatecli): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778
    * The task of moving this service from trusted.ci.jenkins.io to infra.ci.jenkins.io is in progress: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2789 & https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/issues/30

* JFrog incidents
    * "No space left on device"
        * Several persons alerted us they couldn't upload their plugins to Artifactory anymore
        * Jenkins-infra/JFrog exchange: https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/ZdyYIhlNJQY/m/_8LnZBfaAwAJ
        * Daniel Beck deleted around 120Go of data this weekend, but the issue has been resolved since the beginning of this week only as their GC takes a lot of time.
            > The artifacts that were deleted will be removed from the filesystem only once the full garbage collection runs.
            > Please go through this article for more information about the Garbage collection: https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-garbagecollection-mechanism-and-strategies-work-in-artifactory-video/.
            > In SaaS Artifactory instance, the Garbage collection runs for every 4 hours and it is required 20 iterations to run the full Garbage collection.
    * Jesse noted yesterday the service is slow again: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2752#issuecomment-1060827021
    * There were several maintenances announced on their status page and newsletter, an issue to reference them has been opened: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2806
    * JFrog will look if it's possible to extend our maximum capacity (looks like around 5,6To currently)
    * Daniel is excluding some Maven coordinates from artifact resolution in repo.jenkins-ci.org so if you currently download tensorflow or stanford NLP language models from our Artifactory, that's no longer working (there are Java bindings for CUDA and they're 350MB)

* Fastly PURGE requests
    * The Fastly API requests to purge the cache of individual URLs is now requiring an API token, while they were allowed to anyone before. (Purging a service via the API still requires a token, this hasn't changed)
    * Since the possibility to purge individual URLs without any requirement was convenient, the use of labels to allow purging a service is proposed: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2811
    * The alternative is to revert the protection put in place on individual URLs purge requests
        * The protection has been reverted.

* Helpdesk, implementation of issues-similarity
    * This Github Action comments on issues with links to similar ones if founded: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/pull/2807
    * The settings might need some tuning, like lowering the threshold, TBD

* Update security groups with updatecli
    * Goal: automaticaly update security groups on Jenkins controllers setup with EC2 agents (retrieve from jenkins-infra/aws)
    * updatecli trying to improve findSubMatch to specify the index of the capture (golang) => https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/pull/551 wait for release 

* Garbage Collector for cloud resources on Azure => WiP


<!-- delay from next week -->
* IRC notifs
    * TODO: add notifications from infra.ci 

* Core Release Docker image migrated to release.ci

* Stale subjects?
    * Azure AKS clusters
    * AccountApp/Keycloak
    * Disable anti spam for cert team
    * Email on the mailing list (Google groups) are marked as spam
    * Alibaba mirror / mirrors not working? - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2787 => user gave answer, not a mirror issue, but a wider disucssion about mirroring update-center.json
