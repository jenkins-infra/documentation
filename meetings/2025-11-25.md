                    * Windows 2019 deprecation to be discussed with platform SIG.
                    * For infra: let's replace 2022 by 2025 first, then set it as default (and finally remove 2019 later once support stopped).
                    * The AKS cluster `privatek8s` node pool need to be migrated out of Windows 2019 (both hosts and packaging image)
