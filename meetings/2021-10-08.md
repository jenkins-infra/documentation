## Notes :book:

* [INFRA-3088](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3088) Jira maintenance went well
  * Not so well apparently
  * Follow up need, "üòç üê™ üèï üêº" still doesn't work
* Jenkins Core Security update
  * Issues with pkg.jenkins.io
  * release.ci weekly not disabled
      * Each change to the release.ci would enable the job
      * Had to disable it again on Tuesday
      * Configuration as code reverted to enabled release
          * Need to disable release job in code definition
  * Java issues with update-center job
  * Release took longer than expected
  * Missing github release for the weekly
  * Broken changelog content
  * Authorization gaps that had to be filled
* EKS
  * Scalability issues (INFRA-3086)
  * PR [jenkins-infra/aws#33](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/aws/pull/33)
  * fixed : we are hitting rate limit from dockerhub now (private network)
      * Rate limit hits because Docker sees a single IP address
      * Consider pushing to another Docker registry in addition to Dockerhub
  * limit BOM builds
      * +1 from Mark Waite to reduce bom builds significantly
  * cost !?
      * Azure savings have become AWS costs
      * Add small clusters with 
      * Most expensive builds - bom, Jenkins core
  * Gradle enterprise to improve tests
  * Next actions:
      * Multiple docker registries (to avoid rate limit)
      * disable weekly builds of PRs on bom + pipeline shared library. Ref. https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-1633
      * add other Kubernetes clusters to avoid SPOF on EKS (DigitalOcean, Scaleway, and why not local k3s on the 2 OSUSL VMs we used for JIRA and confluence? )
* Letsencrypt root certificate changed
  * Affected ldap.jenkins.io
      * Discovered that a configuration error was using outdated
      * Fixed after a multi-day period where LDAP auth was not working
  * Fastly
      * Some additional work needed here
* Rackspace machine deleted
  * okra.jenkins.io
      * Removed the $700 / month machine that was archives.jenkins.io
      * Running archives.jenkins.io on Oracle Cloud - $25 per month
      * Had to make a phone call, authenticate, etc. to delete machine
  * No further infrastructure on Rackspace
      * Donations from Rackspace ended last year
* Azure dangling vm deleted
    * Damien preparing reports on the cost breakdown for AWS/Azure
