  * Datadog plugin 6.x failures
      * Jenkins plugin `datadog` 6.0.0 made controllers to corrupt build data during a stack overflow error.
          * Corruption fixed by 6.0.1, stack overflow error fixed by 6.0.2 applied everywhere where we use it
      * [ci.jenkins.io incorrectly shows build dates in Dec 1969 (the epoch)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3934)
      * [(Random ?) 404 pages on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3944)
      * [Jenkins controllers logs aren't collected by Datadog](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3943)
  * [Incrementals Publisher is down: 400](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3933)
      * Relies on RPU archived artifacts which were corrupted by datadog (see below)
      * Fixed as RPU ran again with success on ci.jenkins.io
      * Next step: let's start using reports.jenkins.io instead (issue to write @dduportal)
      * Note: thanks @lemeurherve and @timja foir the incremental service upgrades!
  * [Create discourse (community.jenkins.io) service dropdown at helpdesk](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3941)

  * [Massive re-downloads of the same files](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3930)

  * [Agents aren't spawning on infra.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3918)
      * AKS autoscaling from zero does NOT work when using spot instances for nodes :facepalm:
      * Budget is :+1: with keeping always 1 spot instance (infra-reports is run quite often for infra.ci)
  * [In reference to issue #3183](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3338)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/100?closed=1):

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/100):
  * [Export download mirrors list to a textual representation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3832)
      * Deploys mirrors metas to https://reports.jenkins.io/infrastructure/v1/index.json 
      * But there still is an unexpected bug: list is empty except for fallback
  * [Update Jira LTS from 9.4.x to 9.12.x](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3939)

  * [[Jenkins Agents] Clean up deprecated JNLP arguments](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3912)
      * Failed for Azure VM + Azure Containers, both Linux and Windowds. Need to investigate more
  * [Revoke an OpenVPN cert for NotMyFault](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3906)
      * Nothing done here. Let's check if we can diagnose this this week or we will drop it.
      * Most probably here, but it is a question of scope: we can revoke a user, but can we revoke a former cert of a valid user (easily?)
  * [To host versioned jenkins.io docs on docs.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3885)
      * Need to continue working on this one (post-FOSDEM)

  * [Intermittent out of memory for Java 21 builds of Jenkins core on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3874)
      * Nothing done, still need to be investigated
  * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
      * Next step is LDAP: need to plan migration of persistent data (as arm64 VMs are in a different AZ than x86) to a zone-replicated PV and then migrate LDAP to arm64
      * Next candidate: keycloak
      * Still no news from mirrorbits maintainer
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * WiP on the "all in one" image (tools: ruby/bundler) to migrate jenkins-infra/infra-reports to the arm64 image (was using `docker-builder` image)
          * Tricky issues around `PATH` order and ASDF vs. system installations
      * Next candidate: other consumers of `docker-builder` and Puppet (jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra)
      * Long term: spin up a new AKS cluster only for infra.ci agents on the Azure sponsored subscription: see https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3923
  * [Past Release sites are taking long time to load](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3525)
      * Related to [[get.jenkins.io/mirrors/mirrorbit - Azure] High costs due to usage of Azure File Storage](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3917)
      * Tried NFSv4 (premium only) instead of SMB/CIFS in the AKS CSI driver, but failed on the 2 first attempts
      * @lemeurherve raised a long-running question (also raised by @en3hD3iMRx6_6IXLNY0Rag 2 years ago): why not generating this HTML pages on each core release
  * [Check if we could replace `blobxfer` by `azcopy`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414)
      * Good news, @lemeurherve was able to find a way to generate short-lived SAS token using Azure Service Principal
      * WiP on contributors.jenkins.io
      * Next step: update-jenkins-io (and the others)
      * Long term: pkg.origin.jenkins.io VM
      * Blocks [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
  * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)
      * Was making usage of graph view hard for us (terraform and packer jobs on infra.ci)
      * Long running tasks: 1 or 2 jobs max per week
      * WiP: azure (terraform) and packer
  
* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/101)
  * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.27](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3948)
      * Digital Ocean drops 1.26.x end of Feb.
      * WiP: Let's roll for `kubectl` and DigitalOcean clusters (as not used: risk is zero)
      * (Positive) side effect: `kubectl` version on our all-in-one image was incorrect: fixed thanks to this!
      * Next candidate: AWS EKS clusters \o/
  * [update updatecli manifest on sharedtools to add a condition for golang with packer-images versions match](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3937)
    * Golang version is tracked today BUT we only want the image present in the all-in-one image used in production otherwise we break builds for shared-tools and docker-openvpn when upgrading image
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3919 => need to diagnose (closable?)
    * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3923 => @dduportal drives witgh @smerle as secondary
