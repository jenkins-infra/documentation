        * With the Docker image packaging introducing Windows Server 2022 image replacing the 2019 one :clap:
        * We weren't aware it also featured removal of JDK17 (e.g. JDK21 is required). Side effects on packages and Docker images, but fixed on Wednesday 07 January - see https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/issues/729
    * This Week: 2.546 - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$Y1tdSkfT_sZ4VL2ZIe7UV44x6WCGSp-n4bSl7IeIPkA?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im
        * Fixes on packaging
        * No more JDK17 published
2. Announcements:
    * Team capacity:

    * Infra Roadmap: https://www.jenkins.io/project/roadmap/
        * New priorities:
            * Add support for Windows 2025 and deprecated 2019
            * JDK25 as runtime for our controllers
            * Get rid of Puppet (in favor of Ansible)
            * new: ci.jenkins.io => cloud billing and stability 

## Upcoming Calendar 📆

* Next Weekly: 2026-01-20 - 2.547
* Next LTS: 2026-01-21 - 2.541.1
    * Helpdesk opened to collect all related changes: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4945
    * Proposition to publish Docker controller LTS images from a `stable-<release-line>` branch like in packaging and release: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/issues/2195
    * Need Jenkins infra team review on the incoming changelog and upgrade guide (ping both Herve and Damien)
* Next Security Release as per [jenkinsci-advisories](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories): N.A.

        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4893 => Herve and Damien in pair
        * Certificate should be done later today
    * 2026-01-21: Update Center generation fails as the certificate is 30 days before expiration => Damien
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4952 => Damien (needs access to the CA authority)
        * Note: we can temporarily resume Update Center by decreasing the 30 days threshold in trusted.ci.jenkins.io freestyle job if we are stuck
    * 2026-01-27: VPN CRL expires
        * [[private.vpn.jenkins.io] VPN CRL expires on 2026-01-27](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4951) => Herve

        * https://community.jenkins.io/t/jenkins-contributor-summit-on-jan-30-2026-call-for-topics-and-ideas/35773
        * Mark is confirming with people based on the prioritized list from the Jenkins Board

## Cloud Budgets

* Azure CDF - Remaining: $24.000k on 1st January 2026 - monthly threshold set at $6.0k (good until May at the current rate)
    * October: $5.5k (invoice)
    * November: $5.7k (invoice)
    * December: $5.4k (invoice, previously forecasted at $6k)
    * January: $2.2k (forecast at $5.4k)

* DigitalOcean - Remaining $10,549.16 until January 02, 2027 (20 months left at current rate)
    * October: $788.81 (invoice)
    * November: $831.38 (invoice)
    * December: $454.60 (invoice, previously forecasted at $585)
    * January: $144.80 (forecast at ~$345)

* AWS:
    * CloudBees:
        * October: $580
        * November: $530
        * December: $384
        * January: $107 (forecast at $290)
            * A few resources to delete, snapshot of VMLs to transfer from AWS EC2 to Azure blob storage and we can close

    * Sponsored account - $54,613.14 left (31 December 2025) until 31 May 2027=> :warning: 5 months remaining at this rate
        * October: $6.9k
        * November: $5.9k
        * December: $10.7 (previously forecasted at $9.5k way higher than usual)
            * Huge increase due to EC2 plugin bug
        * January: $4.4k (forecast at $11.5k)
            * Still really high, ci.jenkins.io is once again at risk if we don't decrease the consumption or if we don't move it somewhere else before end of April 2026
            * Need an issue ASAP for the EC2 agents GC (Damien)
            * Mark opened an issue on the EC2 plugin: https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/issues/1990
            * Also: we have to request sponsoring renewal

* Jfrog Artifactory Usage
    * Storage: 1.53 Tb - (was 1.53TB last time)
    * Bandwidth:
        * October: 16.67 Tb
        * November: 15.9 Tb
        * December: 30.34Tb
            * A single IP address consumed 12Tb in December
            * JFrog didn't block this address until this month (unless this consumer changed its IP?)
        * January: 6.27 TB Tb (forecast: 16 Tb)
            * Sounds like the abuser stopped abusing
            * One of the top 5 is an Ip from ci.jenkins.io. Not that much compared to external abusers. 
                * Could it be ACP?
                * Priority on EC2 costs first
