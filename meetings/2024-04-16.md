## Attendees ðŸ‘¥


<!-- Handles are community.jenkins.io handles -->

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @smerle33 (StÃ©phane Merle)
* @poddingue (Bruno Verachten)
* @kmartens27 (Kevin Martens)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly: 2.454 is out
    * Release process was :+1: 
    * Changelog has been merged!
    * Usual Packaging stuck on OSUOSL => need infra action, Damien to open an issue to track this, but AFTER the LTS (see below)
    * Docker image is being built
2. Tomorrow is LTS day! Don't break anything
3. Java patch day today: expect PRs to upgrade JDKs soon!

## Cloud Billing

* No cloud billing update this week (Damien's late)
* Azure bill is $100 higher than what the cost explorer shows => this the cost of monthly "standard" support 

## Upcoming Calendar ðŸ“†

* Next Weekly: 2.455 the 23 April 2024
* Next LTS: tomorrow (17 April 2024) 2.440.3
* Next Security Release as per [jenkinsci-advisories](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories): N.A.

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/107?closed=1):
    * [[ci.jenkins.ioâ€“ Startup and build failures with `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/RepositoryCallback`error in the `datadog` plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4039)
    * [[accounts.jenkins.io] Delete account `angelvalangelov`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4037)
    * [Delete account accounts.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4036)

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/107?closed=1):
    * [Requesting permission for "repository-permissions-updater" repository](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4041)
    * [Extend CloudSet for spotinst-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4040)
    * [Pipeline starts every time one of the nodes boots up ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4038)
    * [Weekly repo issue](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4035)
    * [Delete Jira `TEST` project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4005)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/107):
    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Nothing done: HervÃ© is out and StÃ©phane and Damien were busy
    * Linux `arm64`
        * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
            * Controller is now running on `arm64` (along with all agents except a few needed to run on x86_64)
                * Dedicated node pool and subnets (more isolation)
                * Faster unmount/remount (at the cost of init of empty volume to require manual operation)
            * To do before closing:
                * Cleanup of the PV/PVC/disk/snapshots leftovers (resource manually created during operation)
                    * Thursday (after LTS)?
                * Issue opened about using a different storage kind (pricing/performance) to decrease cost
                    * And remove the PVC's `spec.datasource` unused directive
                * Issue to open: The (Jenkins) agent label `linux-arm64` is used for both VM and container. That makes the execution of jobs undeterministic in behavior and execution time
        * [Migrate `release.ci.jenkins.io` to arm64 (controller only)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4042)
            * Controller is now running on `arm64`
                * Dedicated node pool and subnets (more isolation)
                * Weekly release today went well on this one
                * Faster unmount/remount (at the cost of init of empty volume to require manual operation)
            * No agent will be run on arm64!
            * To do before closing:
                * Set up subnet NSG to isolate release.ci (like infra.ci) (issue to add)
                * Cleanup of the PV/PVC/disk/snapshots leftovers (resource manually created during operation) => same operation as infra.ci and weekly.ci cleanups (one shot)
                * Issue opened about using a different storage kind (pricing/performance) to decrease cost
        * Cost on privatek8s cluster
            * Expect increase costs: linuxpool still runs some workload. We want to keep this cost increase because we want isolation between controllers and also other services
        * Next arm64 steps:
            * docker-builder ("all in one" packer image to be used + arm64)
            * LDAP, keycloak migration
            * Ping mirrorbits maintainers

    * [[Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org)] perform a systematic audit of all non-plugin  artifacts in our `releases` repository to identify and quarantine unused artifacts](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4034)
        * Nothing done, need to send an email to the developers mailing list
    * [Release of `jenkins/*` container images on DockerHub errors with `HTTP/429`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4029)
        * We now have spread the outbound requests through 3 IPs (instead of 1)
            * Worked well with docker-agent releases yesterday
            * Worked with weekly Core image today
        * Next step, SIG platform actions:
            * Decrease amout of pulled layers by stop uisng Temurin container images to get the installer (and use the binary installer instead)
                * WiP on controller => Bruno
                * WiP on agents => HervÃ©
        * Keeping the issue opened to track this part
    * [Move the jenkins-stats repositories to the jenkins-infra organization](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4017)
        * Nothing done (yet), need to resume
    * [migrate plugin-site-api generate-data from ci.jenkins.io to infra.ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4009)
        * Nothing done (yet), need to resume
    * New Mirrors
        * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by RCS&RDS](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4003)
        * [New Jenkins mirror in Romania by Hostico](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3976)
        * One has been pinged (missing HTTPS but maintainer was in holidays)
        * Other mirror: need to check FTP credentials
    * [[AWS] Migrate ci.jenkins.io EKS clusters from CloudBees AWS account to Jenkins AWS (sponsored) account](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3954)
        * WiP on bootstrap (terraform for IMA model)
        * Next steps:
            * Perform effective bootstrap in pair
            * Start working on a new "cik8s" cluster for ci.jenkins.io

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/108)
    * [Let's Encrypt Azure Service Principal passwords expired for cert.ci.jenkins.io and trusted.ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4043)
        * StÃ©phane
