## Notes :book:


* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/101?closed=1):

  * [Decouple incrementals-publishers from ci.jenkins.io for permissions check](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3955)
  * [Mirroring of https://packages.atlassian.com/mvn/maven-public/](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3950)
  * [update updatecli manifest on sharedtools to add a condition for golang with packer-images versions match ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3937)
      * Closeable, to be verified by @lemeurherve 
* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/101?closed=1):

  * [unbale to install the jenkins plugin name Role-based Authorization StrategyVersion 689.v731678c3e0eb_](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3953)
  * [Minimum Jenkins version required to support Mac ARM64 architecture](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3952)
  * [Commons-text API : earlier version plugin present on latest version link](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3951)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/101):
    * [Check if we could replace `blobxfer` by `azcopy`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414)
        * SAS short-lived token (using Azure Service Principal) works very well \o/
        * New pipeline library function to take care of this generation (and limit risks as it generates token in a shell system, not on controller)
            * Customizable (token TTL, permissions, etc.)
            * Opportunity to create a new plugin (Azure SAS token ?)
        * contributors.jenkins.io is using it and it work
        * Azcopy is installed (and version tracked) on the VMs (pkg.origin and agent.trusted)
        * WiP:
            * jenkins.io to use this system. But requires a storage account migration (v1 -> v2, but also to Premium to reduce cost from ~70$ monthly to ~6-7 monthly). Might be the same for all other file shares.
            * Install the SAS token shell script in the VMs (pkg.origin and agent.trusted)
  * [Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.27](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3948)
      * Digital Ocean upgraded to 1.27
          * Removed terraform hacks
          * Upgrade is now managed as code
          * Note: we had to bump to latest 1.26 patch before the 1.27 upgrade (this patch update did not happen due to our cert-manager installation which had blockers as per DigitalOcean UI)
      * `kubectl` is now kept up to date on the agent.trusted (for the new Update Center implementation with Cloudflare)
      * Next step: upgrading AWS EKS. Delayed to March.
  * [Update Jira LTS from 9.4.x to 9.12.x](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3939)
      * No news
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Unblocked. Resumed work on using the SAS token generation for this project.
          * Script added (as freestyle job), to be discussed (updatecli? in agent.trusted)
          * Azure SP to be created/updated (currently in error, to be changed)
      * Next step:
          * Migrate to premium storage (transaction costs)
          * Re-test it once and then ask JenSec again for review
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * WiP on replacing `docker-builder` (e.g. `webbuilder`)
          * PATH issue fixed (ruby 3.0 on arm64 polluting our systems)
          * Working on adding Ruby 3.2.x version (windows, updatecli, default version)
          * infra-reports should benefit from this change
      * Next step:
          * NodeJS/NPM and other consumers of "webbuilder" on infra.ci
      * Note: this will create a temporary discrepancy between ci.jenkins.io and infra.ci.jenkins.io.  builds
  * [Add a new private kubernetes cluster in the new sponsored azure subscription](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3923)
      * Delaying to March

   * [Updatecli: Use separated pipelines + organization scanning for all updatecli processes in jenkins-infra](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2778)
       * Let's run the fix ASAP and then delay to March
  * [[uplink] Download failing for `JavaSystemProperties` with `error: missing chunk number 0 for toast value xx in pg_toast_xxx`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3883)
      * Outage today due to database being reindexed
      * Fixed by setting replicas to only 1 to avoid concurent database operations
      * We have to add a startupprobe to the helmchart (as it takes time to run)
      * Still working on cleaning up corrupted records. But not top priority as Daniel does not need this data anymore.
  * [Unexpected delays building small plugin on linux agent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3916)
      * Kubernetes 1.27 is ok on DO. Worth re-enabling DO agents on ci.jenkins.io to check if it is still slow.
      * Delayed to March by default
  * [Export download mirrors list to a textual representation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3832)
      * Fix is needed (to find another page than updates.jenkins.io "latest" redirection. get.jenkins.io should be used). get.jenkins.io provides a page with the list of all configured mirrors, but we have to find it.

=> Delaying the others to March
