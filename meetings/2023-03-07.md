          * LDAP-HA: WiP on Kubernetes
          * Data from Jfrog still being processed to demonstrate if we need to enable auth due to "maven repo1" cache or if it is related to "Jenkins activity" (e.g. a mis-configuration POM).
              * We should check that we do not have our public IP in this list
          * Main priority is focusing on the main consumer's (which is not us anymore) and we need help of Jfrog as our attempts to contact these consumer(s) failed
