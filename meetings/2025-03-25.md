## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.502 released succesfully - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$mbr29TU-bAtcRnWW3IymPywfRQbHCgcbpNabeYHrP48?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
    * This Week: 2.503 in progress - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$vlgPBijxYoG6QUzUX57pYLg9tJaWoymJCRtoFJR03II?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
2. Ingress Nginx CVE (CVE-2025-1974 - https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/24/ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974/#your-next-steps)
    * We were relatively safe as our clusters with an ingress are not multitenant
    * Patched 6 hours ago
    * Additionally: we disabled webhooks admission
    * Important: Ingress Nginx will enter maintenance mode end of 2025: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/13002. We'll have to look at the Gateway API in Kubernetes.

            * Implemented "retry" on buildPlugin pipeline library
            * ci.jenkins.io: all Linux EKS nodes (container agents), and all EC2 VM agents are now using spot instances
                * We selected spot with a <5% (the lowest range) interruption frequency for EC2 VM agents (range was 15-20% with former instance type)
                * Karpenter is expected to select the lowest interruption range: let's see if it works as expected
            * We still have a few "non spot" instances:
                * We have ci.jenkins.io's VM, and the 2 "EKS application nodes"

        * [[ci.jenkins.io] Enable Maven dependencies client-side caching for BOM](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4525)
