## Notes :book:

* [Done](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/98?closed=1):
    * [Lost permission gitlab-branch-source-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3915)
        * Wadeck's security browser extension dedicated to plugin maintainers: https://github.com/Wadeck/extension-jenkins-security
    * [Jira license on issues.jenkins.io expires in 30 days](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3911)
        * Thanks LF and Mark!
    * [Crowdin for next-executions-plugin](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3907)
    * [ci.jenkins.io jobs on Windows agents are much slower than 21 days ago](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3904)
        * Main problem (not completely gone): network issues (SNAT exhaustion)
        * Azure incidents (network... also)
    * [`jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11` missing `arm64` and `s390x`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3893)
        * Removed all "faulty" tags to get rid of this issue at all.
    * [Split docker-jenkins-weekly and docker-jenkins-weekly.ci for infra.ci and weekly.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3887)
        * Different lifecycles for weekly.ci and infra.ci (same core version but different plugin stes)
        * Matter of release lifecycle and distinct updates

* [Closed as not planned](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/98?closed=1):
  * [Anti spam triggered ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3903)
  * [Trying to signup at jenkins ](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3902)
  * [Incorrect email while register](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3914)

* [Work In Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/98):
  * [[get.jenkins.io/mirrors/mirrorbit - Azure] High costs due to usage of Azure File Storage](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3917)
      * Migration to premium storage (still shared storage)
      * Let's create an empty SA of kind premium (from updates.jenkins.io.tf) => @smerle 
      * (related question: does LDAP could benefit from the same upgrade)
  * [Migrate `ci.jenkins.io` to the sponsored subscription](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3913)
      * WiP: created a new empty VM in the subscription
      * Then: copy data one time
      * Once the security release is done, we can start the real migration (and run rsync on the diff for data)
      * Expected gain: is \$500 monthly
  
  * [Azure Kubernetes `publick8s` suffers from SNAT port exhaustion: network slowness](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3908)
      * Decreased TCP timeout from 30min to 4min
      * Adding more port statically (instead of dynamically) => did not had any effect, and made operations worse
      * Added more public IP, but it is paid and rare resource
      * WiP: using NAT gateway in addition (and precedence)
          * privatek8s is now using NAT gateway
          * Don't forget to allow NAT gateway on the control plane of AKS!
          * Todo: publick8s
  * [Agents aren't spawning on infra.ci](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3918)
      * Fixed manually: autoscaling on `arm64` fails when minimum amount of nodes is zero, as soon as there is at least 1 then it works
      * Support case opened to AKS. Related to spot?
      * Migrate to new subscription?
  * [Unexpected delays building small plugin on linux agent](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3916)
      * Issue related to with DigitalOcean ACP service
      * No problem with Azure and AWS ACPs services
      * Challenge: we would want to not consume too much data from Jfrog this month so let's not clean it up nor disable it
      * Given priorities, let's wait with "slow" DigitalOcean builds
      * Long term solutions:
          * Kube 1.27 upgrade could help, but "later"
          * Switch to VM instead of Kube for ACP
      * Short term:
          * Disable ACP DO? => consume more bandwidth
          * Disable DO agents temporarily instead => let's roll for this
            * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/3266
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * 2 container images already moved to "all in one" with `arm64`: docker-helmfile and docker-hashicorp
          * Archived these images resources
          * Jobs migrated
          * Terraform 1.6 is now used (instead 1.1 since months)
          * Less PR to review \o/
      * WiP: container image `docker-builder` (aka. "webbuilder")
          * Not an easy one: used on both ci.jenkins.io and infra.ci.jenkins.io
          * Jobs such as jenkins.io (websites), contributors, etc. depends on it
          * Also: infra-reports
  * [Check if we could replace `blobxfer` by `azcopy`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414)
      * Fact: we cannot revoke actual SAS
      * WiP: change operations to storage account file shares to use short lived SAS
          * Adding a "policy" to SA to allow large scale revoking
          * Need to generate 1 "Service Principal" in each controler to allow them writing to file shares (websites, mirrors, etc.)
          * Then the `az` command line will use the Service Principal + policy to generate 1 hour lived SAS to authenticat to SAs
      * Target file share for contributors.jenkins.io and javadoc first, then the others
      * Puppet: install `azcopy` on pkg VM
  * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Good candidate for the above "azcopy" short lived TTL
  * [[uplink] Download failing for `JavaSystemProperties` with `error: missing chunk number 0 for toast value xx in pg_toast_xxx`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3883)
      * One corrupted record deleted from the table
      * WiP: Searching for another corrupted record
  
  * [[Jenkins Agents] Clean up deprecated JNLP arguments](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3912)
      * Delay for later (after FOSDEM)
  * [Revoke an OpenVPN cert for NotMyFault](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3906)
      * Delay for later (after FOSDEM)
  * [To host versioned jenkins.io docs on docs.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3885)
      * No progress last week (other priorities)
      * Given our GSoc candidate is in exams right now and Kevin is not blocked immediately, let's delay after FOSDEM
  * [Intermittent out of memory for Java 21 builds of Jenkins core on ci.jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3874)
      * No progress last week (other priorities)
      * Delay for later (after FOSDEM)
  * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
      * LDAP: 
          * Image update (was an old one) thanks to Docker Bake
          * arm64 require running on a different availability zone. Current storage is in different zone than arm64 nodes
      * Delay for later (after FOSDEM)
  * [Export download mirrors list to a textual representation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3832)
      * Goal is now clearer and scoped
      * No progress last week (other priorities)
  
  * (new) infra.ci GitHub API rate limiting
      * We could use different GH apps to spread the API rate limits and avoid blocking us from delivering from infra.ci
  * Docker Hub:
      * Last 3 releases of the Docker inbound agent images due to "HTTP/429 Rate Limit" on DockerHub. Was an issue on DockerHub
      * Looks like we've been removed and added back (confirmed by them), our system were removed from Open Source programe (hence the API rate limit). But it is fixed
      * Thanks Docker for continuing to sponsor us!
      * And new feature are available to us: Docker Scout!
  
* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/99)
