# Infra Meetings

## Publish Meeting Notes

Publishing the meeting notes follows these steps:

1. <<Publish Recording to YouTube>>
2. <<Publish Notes to community.jenkins.io>>
3. <<Publish Note to GitHub>>

### Publish Recording to YouTube

Once the Zoom cloud recording of the previous meeting is available:

* Log-in in Zoom with the CDF account (or the account owning the recording)
* Download the recording, which is composed of 3 files:
** An `mp4` video (+audio) recording
** An `mp4` audio-only recording
** A `vss` text file with the audio transcript

* Check the name of the previous recordings in the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/jenkinscicd
** Should be something like `YYYY MM DD Jenkins Infra Meeting`

* Rename the mp4 video to follow the name pattern
** You can delete the audio-only and transcript file (not needed)

* Generate a media cover from https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q1PgNnRTgzBpVRXPqQo3PudzCa2eoc6_1_NRjFRMLrU/edit?usp=sharing
** Keep the same naming pattern (e.g. `YYYY MM DD Jenkins Infra Meeting`) in the media cover
** Download it as PNG

* Log-in on YouTube, and then change account to "Jenkins" (top-right button with your account avatar -> "change account" menu item -> "Jenkins")
** If you do not have access to it, request it on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list

* Click on "Upload video", select the `mp4` renamed file
* While it is uploading:
** Click on "add thumbnail" and select the PNG file (used for OpenGraph)
** Select the playlist "Jenkins Infrastructure Project"
** No, it's not made for kids (we never know)
** Category: Science & technologies
** No monetization

* Save as Public (no need for copyright for infra meeting)
** While its processing, you can already get the link to put in the meeting notes

* Check the video is correctly published on Youtube, then delete it from the Zoom account

### Publish Notes to community.jenkins.io

Once you have a YouTube link to the published recording:

* Log-in on https://community.jenkins.io
* On the category "Contributing", click the label "Infrastructure"
* Click on the button "New Topic": that should open a popup with the pre-filled categories "Contributing" and "Infrastructure"
* Set the name to `Infrastructure Team Meeting - <month> DD, YYYY`
* Copy the YouTube link as first line of the post
* Copy and paste, from the corresponding https://hackmd.io collaborative notes, the following text sections:
** "Attendees"
** "Announcements :loudspeaker:"
** "Notes :book:"
* Add the labels "meetings" and "sig-infra"
* You can proceed to publish the topic


### Publish Note to GitHub

* Browse to the corresponding https://hackmd.io collaborative notes
* Update the last section:
** Add an `x` on each of the textual checkboxes
** Add the YouTube and community link on the corresponding bullet lists

* On the top right toolbar, click the "..." (3 points) buttons which shows an "options menu"
* Select the "Versions and GitHub Sync" menu item, which open a modal window
* Click on the "Push to GitHub" button
* Select "Switch" if you have a popup warning about endlines
* Fill the form:
** Repository is link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation[jenkins-infra/documentation]
** Branch: `main`
** Select file: create a new file by specifying the expected path `meetings/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
** Choose version to push: set "Name" to publish (it's the short commit message, it's enough)
* Click the button "Push"

* Once pushed to GitHub, you can safely delete the collaborative note from hackmd.io
