## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins Weekly Releases
    * Last Week: 2.511, succesfully released, no "maven-metadata" issue (like in 2.510) - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$g0s2qo40awdXFA6q08a0gjB3MeRLGOO9J7dAR66jFyE?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
    * This Week: 2.512 started on time - https://matrix.to/#/!JlkqzpdEnsUUuVtjgE:matrix.org/$RbTA8TJR9F943NP8CGsAvrVfbfXNoqqG5-DIebDSQxI?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
2. Announcements:
    * Most of the infra team is off this week (Mark yesterday, Jay today, Stephane and Damien Thursday and Friday)
        * Low bandwidth for upcoming milestone
    * We have guests (GSoC LLM project): welcome :wave:
        * Are there pain point in the day to day in infra which could be studied by the PoC (and eventually solved by the LLM GSoC project)?
        * Let's focus on the public data, which lacks "easy entry" documentation and visualization.
        * Most of our data is private and sensitive
        * Maybe helping around the move Puppet -> Ansible? 
        * Need to measure and specify the resources requirements so we can evaluate prices
    * Azure CDF subscription issues: billing ownership transferred to CDF
        * Microsoft did loose the costs data since the 21 of may, and again since the 26 of may (each billing ownershipt transfer)
        * LF/CDF did ask for May data, which should be available after the 10 June
        * We should still be able to see data starting today

    * JDK21 runtime for Jenkins controllers and agents
        * [Move controllers to JDK21 (runtime)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4123)
        * [Move agents to JDK21 (runtime)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4121)
    * Keep jenkins-infra up to date:
        * [[infra.ci.jenkins.io/packer-images] Azure Credential used by Packer Image builds expire 2025-05-22T00:00:00Z](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4668)

            * Azure announced depreciation of Ubuntu 20.04 machines. No stopping existing ones, we can re-create machine from disk snapshot, but not from empty OS installation image. Let's take one today :)
    * Support:
        * [Internal server error when trying to log in to Uplink](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4667)

* [Work in Progress](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/162):
    * Support:
        * [Restore jenkinsci/jenkins build stability](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4662)
        * [Update Jira LTS from 9.12.x to 10.3.x](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4644)
            * No news from LF, Mark tracks this one. (EOL is in September)
    * Keep jenkins-infra up to date:
        * [OSUOSL: decrease mirror dependency](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4653)
            * archives.jenkins.io is the reference for get.jenkins.io content mirrors
                * It has public rsync, at least for upcoming 7 days. Then we'll restrict by IP.
            * Next week: switch sync scripts (pkg <-> archives <-> OSUOSL)
    * [packer-images: use api.adoptium.net for updatecli and installation of JDKs](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4640)
        * WiP: install adoptium binaries (all in one image) with checksum using official API. Linux is good and Windows in progress.
        * WiP: track URL and checksum with updatecli (which effectively uses the API)
        * Reminder: requirement to allow adding JDK25 in the platform
      * [Monitor builds on our private instances (trusted.ci.jenkins.io / infra.ci.jenkins.io / release.ci.jenkins.io)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2843)

          * Migration scripts/doc is broken or break things.
          * Token management is also broken.
          * WiP: public project using the "import" technique in terraform: no more terraform state for current resources until finished.
          * Next step: find a way to manage token from scratch.

    * [2025 Cloud Usage: ensure that we can run until end of year](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4618)
        * Paused due to the Azure billing issues.
        * Next (issues to be created): trusted.ci and cert.ci controllers. Let's move to lower instance quality
            * arm64? Lower size? Lower quality (burstable instance)?
        * Mark follows up with AWS sponsorship
  
    * [Use JDK21 Platform-wide](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4120)
        * 3 remaining issues:
            * 1 closed (as not needed anymore)
            * 1 to be closed with links (pipeline library) => @dduportal 
            * 1 remaining: default build java (JAVA_HOME and PATH) from JDK17 to JDK21 => @smerle

                * should be ok for BOM (modulo an issue)
                * Important: can we switch the Jenkins Core build (docker-packaging) to use JDK21? Need mailing list thread
