    * [[INFRA-3100] Migrate updates.jenkins.io to another Cloud](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
        * Crawler job update to copy tool installs metadata to our ne mirrors
        * Update Center job PR ready to review with a feature flag to allow disabling without reverting
            * Ability to add new mirror buckets in parallel
        * Functional test is success (even though we had different behavior between Jenkins UI and `jenkins-plugin-cli`)
        * The (new) mirrorbits UC instance has the automatic mirror scan disabled now (as it is trigger every 3 minutes) to avoid (concurent) errors
        * Next steps:
            * Verify update-center2 once PR is merged (don't forget backups on the pkg.jenkins.io VM before)
            * Copy the "not updated" tool installer which are not updated since years from the pkg.jenkins.io VM to our mirror (as crawler does not update these 2)
            * JEP to start
            * Plan adding a `us-east` mirror
            * Plan a brownout test if we get enough approval on the JEP draft
            * Performance test of the new mirrorbits
    * [Proposal for application in publick8s to migrate to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3619)
        * All `plugin-site*` service migrated (front, back and issues)
        * Migrated `httpd` and `rsync` for the new UC chart

        * Good news: successfull build on ci.jenkins without requiring the `docker` pipeline agent (e.g. easier to merge pipelines and keep docker VM requirement away)
