        * Mark recommends not working on this since it has been that way for a very long time
        * Proposal to switch from blobxfer to azcopy would support symlink dereference
            * Might be fixed as a happy side effect of other changes related to azcopy
            * Link exists for some cases and not for other cases
        * Consider placing the azcopy task into the new milestone: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414
  
    * [Did not receive email regarding the password](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3859)

  * [Migration left over from publicK8s to arm64](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3837)
      * Stephane forgot a few services that remained on publick8s
      * Services not as easy to migrate, will need more testing
      * Keycloak and LDAP are storing persistent data, so would need the volume migration technique used previously
          * That migration requires a stop of the service, would need planning
          * Intentionally postponing
      * Mirrorbits does not have an ARM64 image yet
          * Proposed an ARM64 image, not yet ready
      * OK to pause, return to it
  * [Export download mirrors list to a textual representation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3832)
      * Want a list of mirrors used by get.jenkins.io as a report from infra.ci.jenkins.io
          * Started with a pull request skeleton with a bash script that parses the page to a text file
          * Not good enough, need to provide a json file will all IP addresses of the mirrors
          * Not specific to mirrorbits, be more generic by using a JSON format (more extensible)
  * [[get.jenkins.io] migrate from `mirrorbits` to `mirrorbits-parent` chart](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3828)
      * No work yet, will use the new helm charts from Damien and Herve
  * [[publick8s] Tune node pool size](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3827)
      * Created a new smaller, less expensive Intel node pool and migrated services to the lower cost nodes
      * Using 5 nodes when we were expecting 3 nodes
          * Investigated on CPU consumption and think we may even be able to reduce limits to pack more effectively
          * Savings expected from those changes
  * [infra.ci.jenkins.io on `arm64` (controller and agents)](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3823)
      * ARM64 agents added on infra.ci.jenkins.io
      * Small node pool, similar to what we did elsewhere
      * Plan migration of infra.ci.jenkins.io to ARM64, will switch to a zone friendly volume
  * [[Sponsorships] Setup the secondary Azure subscription to consume the sponsor credits](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3818)

      * Under budget for Nov 2023 as well (even without secondary)
      * 
  * [[Sponsorships] Renew DigitalOcean sponsorship for 2024](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3817)
      * DigitalOcean has agreed to renew the sponsorship
      * Wait until current sponsorship is complete in January 2024
      * Thanks to DigitalOcean
  * [Packer: GOSS version tracking and moving sanity check to goss](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3763)
      * Stephane is working on the Windows portion of GOSS, ongoing effort to match updatecli and GOSS
          * Need a pause before launching GOSS, unclear why a pause is needed or why it helps
          * Passing tests tell us the  system is well configured
  * [Redirect Chinese pages to English pages and shutdown the Chinese site](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3379)
      * Kevin has installed minikube and other parts, stuck with some operations
          * Looking at the rewrite to do the redirect
      * Mark has not done his part, not yet ready for a session with Damien
  * [[sponsors] [INFRA-3122] Check for Scaleway sponsorship](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2668)
