## Notes :book:

* Previous weekly Jenkins build failure
  * Fixed by updating the Docker image: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-packaging/releases/tag/1.1.0 (both tags `1.1.0` and `latest`)
  * Should be Ok for the LTS (no changes in the release script)
  * For next weekly: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-packaging/issues/16#issuecomment-977661929

* apt-get upgrade campaign => need for inventory
    * ci, trusted, vpn, archives, pkg, updates, rating, bounce, OSUSL machines (was for jira an confluence)
        * Checked machines for current status
    * could not access census.jenkins.io
        * Mark and Damien do not have access
        * Damien will send public
    * Other VMs?
    * Issues:
        * rating & bounce: reboot not working, had to change instance type from `t2.micro` to `t2.nano` (hypervisor change)
        * archives: see below (indirect impact)
        * pkg.jenkins.io: frankeinstein-ubuntu (mix of xenial/bionic + packages to remove such as `iw` / `crda)
            * Fixed with the help fo Mark during the weekly this week
            * Weekly release 2.323 delayed while this was repaired
        * usage.jenkins.io: we fell under https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-1563: the 500 G volume was not remounted after reboot
            * Andrew opened https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3142 and we fixed by persisting the fstab "manually" until we move to Azure
            * Planning to move that service to Kubernetes
* Outages
    * jenkins.io, post mortem: https://hackmd.io/VFHwqgZ6QBq-Jt_Dqa42Vg
    * archives.jenkins.io today
        * Fixed (issue with the bandwidth module in Apache after kernel upgrade thanks @halkeye)
        * Removed the bandwidth limit - need to grant Oracle Cloud access to all infra team memb
        * post mortem TODO (@dduportal)
* Kubernetes 1.20 upgrade
    * Done, success! Thanks @Ui7sZO86Rq-0GudX4caAvQ (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3118)
    * EKS: We add to manage more resources with Terraform: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/aws/pull/51
    * Next step: 1.21, improvements in procedure for EKS
        * addons
            * DNS network driver to allow pods on private networks
                * Managed by EKS and Terraform to assure we can use Kubernetes
        * workers pool upgrades
            * put major k8s version in their names
    * Next Kubernetes upgrade 1.20 to 1.21
* TLS cert for repo.jenkins-ci.org 
    * We should ask KK to handover, WDYT?
        * Has JFrog completed the process?
        * JFrog says they are ready, need to send certificate to JFrog
        * @dduportal
* Oracle Cloud:
    * Access for Damien and Herve and Tim and Gavin?
    * Could we integrate with Azure AD to centralize management?
    * Mark work with Tim to grant access to all the right people
* Terraform for More Clouds
    * EPIC: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3135
    * WiP on the library https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-3132
* Costs
    * AWS: 8.7 kâ‚¬ today, 8.9kâ‚¬ forecasted (Less than 9k this month !)
    * Azure: 8.2kâ‚¬ today, 8.6 kâ‚¬ forecasted
    * Improvements still to be made, but dramatic savings already
* "updatecli" campaign:
    * The Terraform repositories jenkins-infra/aws and jenkins-infra/terraform-states(private) are now tracked by updatecli (both providers and modules)
    * todo:
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-datadog
        * https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-crond
    * (WIP) shared pipelines
        * [Terraform](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/258)
        * [Docker build+publish & Updatecli](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/259)
    
* ".io" domain renewal:
     * The renewal will increase starting in January 1, 2022. For example, with Gandhi it increases from $42 to $55
         * Some cost savings available this year
     * Gandhi recommends on their website to renew for the maximum of years before the end of the year (up to 9 years renewal in advance) 
         * Who is the domain registrar for jenkins.io?
             * Likely through Tyler Croy
             * Herve willing to connect with Tyler on domain renewal
* fastly-as-code
     * https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fastly/fastly/latest/docs
     * Domains are managed by the fastly UI today
     * Prefer to manage as code in the future
         * @dduportal add to the terraform epic
* Test new solutions, cf https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/k59uSNgPL08/m/4Hx6JQuHBgAJ
     * Gradle Enterprise
     * Launchable
     * Continue discussions email, then discuss next week in meeting
* Karpenter (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-karpenter-an-open-source-high-performance-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler/)
    * Not limited to AWS, could make our scaling easier
    * Scaleway has a provider-agnostic tool as well
