    * August: $5,816 (expecting invoice of $5.9k with support)
    * September: $5.8k (forecast at $6.0k)
        * We should be able to target <=$5.9k in October 
       
* DigitalOcean - Remaining $12,790 until January 02, 2026
    * June: $252 (invoice)

        * August: $662.80
        * September: $680 forecast at $700
            * Increased due to migration of usage (sending data out of AWS costs us some bucks in outbound bandwidth)

        * July: 24.96 Tb (23.45 Tb for 'releases' repository)
        * August: 21.09 Tb - (18.77 Tb for 'releases' repository)

            * Forecast at ~20.5Tb :+1: 
            * Abuse report sent for 3 IPs in AWS Ireland. Investigation in progress. These IPs are still the largest consumers.
                * Also asked JFrog if we can block them, contact OOO, let's see in October
                * Last 3 days show significantly lower bandwidth use from the three AWS Ireland IP addresses
