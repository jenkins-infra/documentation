## Attendees

* @dduportal (Damien Duportal)
* @hlemeur (Herv√© Le Meur)
* @smerle33 (St√©phane Merle)

## Announcements :loudspeaker:

1. Weekly 2.351: issues 
    * Infra issues (Kubernetes <-> Jenkins configuration)
    * docker/packaging ubuntu 22.04. `createrepo` -> `createrepo_c`. Issues: Openssl + JDK changes.
    * Let's continue to watch this release.

## Notes :book:

* Done (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/19?closed=1)
  * [Nginx 1.22](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2968)
      * Done everywhere, no need for ingress as it is still using 1.19
  * [Build our own Windows Docker Images](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2873)
      * Great job! A lot of pipeline-library and powershell tricky tricks
      * Deployed to ci.jenkins.io with no problem
      * Note: we broke infra.ci while trying to execute Windows pod agents (we added a node pool of Windows type, and kubernetes tried to reschedule infra.ci, which led to failure in diskchk for the data volume)
  * [Update center certificate expired + crawling](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2950)
      * Reminder: Only Olivier, KK and Oleg have the CA key.
      * Olivier generated a new cert and uploaded it to trusted.ci for us
      * Doc + runbook + calendar up to date
      * Jobs fixed in trusted.ci \o/
  * [Use `docker` instead of `img` by default](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2952)
      * Looks good! Faster builds/tests (but more VMs)
      * Let's remove `img` now!
  * [ci.jenkins.io: All highmem agents are stuck](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2971)
      * Many thanks Alex for notifying us!
      * Cause was a new behavior in the azure-vm plugin. Rollbacked on the plugin by Tim (but new release not installed yet)
      * We changed the retention policy for azure VM to "use only once": sounds like it mitigated the issue
  * [Weekly 2.350 failed due to missing `mb` command](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2967)
      * Consequence of mirrorbain sunsetting.
      * Fixed in the release scripts at <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/mirror-scripts>
      * More mirrorbrain cleanup is needed: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2970
  * [release.ci.jenkins.io is down](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2966)
      * Kubernetes management PR merged which restarted the controller
  * [IRC cloak for libera](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2965)
      * Thanks @timja 

* Work in Progress (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/19)
  * [Docker Rate Limit blocking jenkinsci/docker builds](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2961)
      * 
  * [bootstrap terraform oracle project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2973)
      * Blocks the ["update center in oracle"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649) and "import oracle" resources tasks
      * States in Azure, we are able to manage user and API key with terraform as well. Wip in secrets to be stored in SOPS, then we init. the project
      * Main issue: due to the `azuread` SSO, it's tricky to get an API key. Gotta need Mark help (as initial admin). Short term: we used a local technical user with MFA.
  * [Digital Ocean sponsorship](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2917)
      * Thanks for checking the costs @lemeurherve ! Sounds good
      * We have to take an appointment with them
  * [Kubernetes 1.22](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2930)
      * WiP: kubectl upgrade to 1.22: updatecli is OK (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-helmfile/pull/105)
      * Blocked by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/kubernetes-management/pull/2403
  * [Remove `img`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2963)
      * PRs opened on [pipeline-library](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/404) and [docker-builder](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-builder/pull/59)
  * ["update center in oracle"](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649)
      * Todo, blocked by [bootstrap terraform oracle project](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2973)
  * [Auto notify people based on service routing rules](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2827)
      * Not worked on it yet

* New/Importants [`infra-team-sync-next`](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/10)
    * docker-packaging update: impact on weekly. Issue to be written @dduportal - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2978
    * infra.ci backups @lemeurherve - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2976
    * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-49707 for retrying builds when agents are trashed (spot instances, etc.)
    * Some pipeline libraries minor test fixes for @lemeurherve - https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/pull/400
 

* ToDo (next milestone) (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/milestone/20)
