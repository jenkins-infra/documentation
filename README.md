# Documentation

This repository's purpose is to keep track of the knowledge around the Jenkins infrastructure project.
It gathers information for the following areas:

* "Maintenance" section contains document used to prepare service maintenances like systems upgrade.
* "Meeting" section contains meeting notes
* "Service" section contains service descriptions

The contribution workflow depends on either you want a "synchronous" or "asynchronous" communication.

In the case of "synchronous" communication, use [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/team/jenkins-infra) with documents linked in the `jenkins-infra` channel. Once the collaboration is done, a maintainer needs to push the document into this repository.
Feel free to request access to the jenkins-infra team on hackmd.io. Our goals is to only avoid spammers.

In the case of "asynchronous" communication, open a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to ask for a review
from maintainers to provide feedback, share knowledge and benefit from the Github notifications system.

There are cases where documentation lies somewhere else like the private repository [jenkins-infra/runbook](github.com/jenkins-infra/runbooks). In such cases, it's better to provide a link from [jenkins-infra/documentation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation), referencing thirds document elsewhere as [jenkins-infra/runbook](github.com/jenkins-infra/runbooks). The purpose is to use jenkins-infra/documentation as the central source of knowledge but to keep the ability to have information where it belongs.

## Contributing

They are different ways to contribute to this repository.

### Request specific documentation

Whatever your motivation is, either specific information needs or just curiosity, feel free to request content documentation, smaller the request is the easier documenting it will be.
To request specific documentation, you can open a [Jira](https://issues.jenkins.io) issue on the 'INFRA' project using the component name "documentation" and then assign it to the right person.
